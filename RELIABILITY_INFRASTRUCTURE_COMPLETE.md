## 🔧 Implementation Summary

### 1A: Circuit Breaker Implementation ✅

**Location**: `backend/reliability_infrastructure.py` (Lines 30-200)

**Features Implemented**:

- ✅ Configurable failure threshold (default 5 failures)
- ✅ Automatic recovery detection after timeout period
- ✅ Circuit breaker protection for all Neo4j write operations
- ✅ Failure counting, state transitions, and recovery logic
- ✅ Existing bridge functionality preserved when CLOSED

**Key Components**:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    - State management (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN)
    - Failure threshold tracking (default 5)
    - Recovery timeout (default 60s)
    - Automatic state transitions
    - Metrics collection and callbacks
```

**Integration**: Enhanced Neo4j service wraps all operations with circuit breaker protection.

### 1B: Transactional Integrity System ✅

**Location**: `backend/reliability_infrastructure.py` (Lines 201-420)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Atomic transaction management for all Neo4j operations
- ✅ All-or-nothing batch processing (entity + relationship + citation creation)
- ✅ Complete rollback on any failure
- ✅ Transaction boundaries around complete file processing
- ✅ Pre-transaction validation and state tracking
- ✅ Maintains existing batch processing capabilities

**Key Components**:

  - Connection errors → exponential backoff
  - Timeout errors → linear backoff  
  - Validation errors → manual review
- ✅ Background processor for automatic retries
- ✅ Escalation to manual intervention queue
- ✅ Integration with existing error handling

**Key Components**:
```python
class DeadLetterQueue:
    - Persistent storage with JSON serialization
