We are grateful to have you here. We are here to support you in delivering our mission to every customer, every day. Welcome to our Family! Sincerely,Sean Bauer & George Saliba Bauer Food LLC Bauer Food LLC is run by Sean Bauer and George Saliba. Two great friends who both started as crew at McDonald\u2019s a long, long time ago.

It could also be another crew member, manager, a vendor, our corporate partners, or community personnel like the police, fire, and health dept. In short, \u201cyour\u201d means anyone and everyone that comes to our restaurant!4QUALITY: Doesn\u2019t having a hot fresh amazing tasting meal with a friend make your day better? That\u2019s why Quality of the food that we serve is extremely important. SERVICE: Does fast Service with a smile make your day better? Absolutely! ACCURACY: If you order and pay for something, but you don\u2019t get it or get something different, does that make your day better? Almost certainly not, that\u2019s why we must make sure to provide Accurate orders. CLEANLINESS: How about eating in a Clean environment that smells good and makes you feel good about the food you\u2019re eating? Dirty stores definitely don\u2019t make people\u2019s days better. FOOD SAFETY: If the food you eat makes you ill, it most certainly makes your day worse, not better, therefore being careful to ensure Safe Food is prepared is a critical priority. 5When you hear about world changing companies, you often hear about companies like Google or Apple, but what about McDonald\u2019s?

      "Food is prepared is a critical priority. 5When you hear about world changing companies, you often hear about companies like Google or Apple, but what about McDonald\u2019s? Can we make the world a better place? CONSIDER THIS: Google employs about 72,000 people and Apple employs 47 ,000 people. McDonald\u2019s employs over 1.5 Million people, more than 30 times the number of employees at Apple. From an employment perspective, we have a much greater opportunity to make lives better than Google and Apple combined. McDonald\u2019s feeds 68 million people each day. Your individual restaurant has about 500,000 visits a year! Do you make an impact in those people\u2019s lives each day? Absolutely! What do you think would make the world better? If everyone looked at their phone more, or if everyone had a great meal with a smile and a face to face conversation with a friend? If we can make each customer\u2019s visit happy by giving them a great tasting meal with fast, friendly service, in a clean restaurant, then we will make their day better. In turn, they will be happier and more friendly to the people they come in contact with the rest of the day (think about how you feel after a great meal served by nice people). And so on. What happens when 68 million people each day are happier and nicer because of how we treated them? Right, a better world. We can make a difference with every customer we serve, every burger we make, and every floor we clean. You CAN change the world, one customer visit at a time.6 Smile and greet people. \u201cKindness is a gift everyone can afford to give\u201d \u201cA positive attitude leads to positive outcomes\u201d Be here on time every day, \u201c90% of success is showing up\u201d \u201cDo what you do so well they will want to see it again, and bring their friends\u201d \u2014 Walt Disney7Taking care of the people who take care of our customers is one of your management team\u2019s top priorities.

      "premises. \u2022 Breaks: Breaks will be provided depending on your work hours. Breaks range from a quick pause for something to drink to a 35 minute lunch break. State law and the number of hours you work will dictate the length of your break. While on break, you will not be permitted to be on the floor or behind the front counter. If an employee wishes to decline a break, a waiver must be signed. \u2022 Funeral Leave: If a member of your immediate family should die, you will be paid for the scheduled working hours on the day of the funeral. Your immediate family includes your spouse or spouse\u2019s mother or father, grandparents, sister, brother, son, or daughter, mother or father, or step equivalent. \u2022 Leaves of Absence: If you find you must temporarily leave active employment at this McDonald\u2019s because of school obligations, travel or other reasons, you may request a leave of absence, which your management team will consider. Full details are available through your management team. \u2022 Medical/Disability Leave: Our medical/disability leave policy is subject to the guidelines set forth in the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Under that federal law, if you have worked for the company for one year, and worked 1,250 hours during that year, you are entitled to up to 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave for the purpose of (1) taking care of yourself or a member of your immediate family when that person is suffering from a serious illness, (2) taking maternity or paternity leave, or (3) adopting a child. This 12-week period will be offset by your existing vacation or sick leave entitlement. For instance, if you are seriously ill, and have 2 weeks vacation time coming, you must first exhaust your 2 weeks vacation. After that, you will be entitled to up to 10 more weeks in that year of unpaid FMLA leave as described above. During this 12-week period, we will hold your job, or a substantially similar job, and assign it back to you until your return. Your health insurance coverage will also continue during this 12-week period. Your share of the premium payments will be do on the 1st of the month, each month until employee returns from leave. There will be a 30-day grace period in which to make premium payments. If payment is not made timely, your group health insurance may be cancelled. However, after you have exhausted 12 weeks of sick leave in any given year, management reserves the option to terminate your employment, at which time your medical insurance coverage and other benefits will cease. At that point, you would be eligible for continued medical coverage at your expense through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Further details of the FMLA are contained in a posting on the wall in the Crew Room. If you have any other questions about the applicability of the FMLA, please contact your manager.10If you have not been employed by the company long enough to be eligible for coverage under the FMLA, the company may, in",

Any form that is given to a member of management is placed inside a weekly folder that is delivered to the office on Monday\u2019s each week. Please be aware that unless you fax the form directly to the office, we will not see anything until Monday of each week. All forms are directly faxed back to the offices that are requesting the information. We do not give any type of forms that verify employment or wages back to the employee directly. Also, if you require a copy of a paycheck stub, there will be a $5.00 charge on your next paycheck. Everyone receives a paycheck stub on scheduled pay dates, and reprinting them is a cost to our Company. Please keep these in a safe place if you know you\u2019ll need them for future reference.

As the largest restaurant business system, with an extremely high public awareness, we are often looked to for leadership on issues which directly and indirectly relate to our reputation.

We share their belief in their right to exist in an environment of clean air, clean earth and clean water. We look at every part of our business to determine its impact on the environment, and take action beyond what is expected if we feel those actions will help leave future generations an environmentally sound world. 24Our environmental commitment and activities are guided by the following principles: \u2022 Effectively managing solid waste: We are committed to taking a \u201ctotal lifecycle\u201d approach to solid waste.

      "take aggressive measures to minimize energy and other resource consumption through increased efficiency and conservation. We will not permit the destruction of rainforests for our beef supply. This policy is strictly enforced and closely monitored. \u2022 Reduce: We will take steps to reduce the weight and/or volume of the packaging we use. This may mean eliminating packaging, adopting thinner and lighter packaging, changing manufacturing and distribution systems, adopting new technologies, or using alternative materials. We will continue to search for materials that are environmentally preferable. \u2022 Reuse: We will implement reusable materials whenever feasible within our operations and distributions systems as long as they do not compromise our safety and sanitation standards, customer expectations, nor are offset by other environmental or safety concerns. \u2022 Recycle: We are committed to the maximum use of recycled materials in constructing, equipping and operating our restaurants. We are already the largest user of recycled paper in our industry, applying it to tray liners, napkins, Happy Meal boxes, carry out bags and carry out trays. Finally, we are committed to timely, honest and forthright communications with our customers, shareholders and employees regarding all of our environmental policies. We will continue to seek the counsel of experts in the environmental field. By maintaining a productive, ongoing dialogue, we will learn from them and move closer to doing all we can to preserve the environment.

DISCIPLINARY STATEMENT The following is the Disciplinary Guideline we use to reinforce McDonald\u2019s policies. It is important that Management uses counseling for performance problems and non-flagrant policy issues. These counseling sessions should be documented. In cases where minor or less serious policy violations occur, we will normally take the following steps: First Violation: Verbal Warning (Documented), active for 12 months.Second Violation: Written Warning (Documented), active for 12 months. This warning must be reviewed and signed by your Store Manager.Third Violation: Written Warning (Documented) and Termination.In situations where serious offenses have occurred, or are suspected to have occurred (theft, unlawful acts, gross misbehavior, intoxication, sexual harassment, insubordination, etc.) it may be necessary to use an investigation period. During this investigation period, you may be unscheduled. This will be considered a suspension pending investigation. At the conclusion of this investigation, a disciplinary determination will be made. Depending upon the results of the investigation, prior work history, and the severity of the offense(s), the disciplinary action will range from a warning to a one (1) or two (2) week unpaid suspension to a termination. Each situation will be reviewed by the Manager, Supervisor, and Owner/Operator.
