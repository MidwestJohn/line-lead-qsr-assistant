# ðŸ§ª PDF Preview Integration Test

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing PDF Preview in DocumentList

### How to Test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click the "Documents" button (BookOpen icon) in header
3. Look for uploaded PDF files in the document list
4. Check for "Preview" buttons (Eye icon) next to PDF files
5. Click a Preview button to open the PDF modal

### Expected Behavior:

#### âœ… Visual Elements:
- [ ] Eye icon appears next to delete button for PDF files only
- [ ] Preview button matches delete button styling
- [ ] Both buttons have proper spacing (6px gap)
- [ ] Hover states work for preview button (red accent)
- [ ] Touch-friendly sizing on mobile (32px minimum)

#### âœ… Functionality:
- [ ] Preview button only shows for files with .pdf extension
- [ ] Clicking preview opens PDF modal with correct file
- [ ] Modal displays document filename in header
- [ ] PDF renders correctly from backend file serving
- [ ] Modal closes properly without affecting document list
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (delete, file info)

#### âœ… File Serving:
- [ ] Backend serves PDFs at `/uploads/{filename}`
- [ ] Static file serving configured correctly
- [ ] PDF URLs resolve properly
- [ ] No CORS issues with file access

### Test Files Available:
Based on uploads directory, these PDFs should be available for testing:
- Drifters-FOH-Manual.pdf
- Preview-Line Cook Training Manual - QSR.pdf
- Servers_Training_Manual.pdf

### API Integration:
- Document list fetched from `/documents` endpoint
- File URLs constructed as `${API_BASE_URL}/uploads/${doc.filename}`
- PDF modal receives fileUrl and filename props
- Error handling for missing/invalid file URLs

### Mobile Testing:
- Test on mobile viewport (< 768px)
- Ensure buttons remain touch-friendly
- Verify modal works on mobile devices
- Check responsive layout doesn't break

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Non-PDF files don't show preview button
- [ ] Files with missing URLs handled gracefully
- [ ] Large PDF files load properly
- [ ] Network errors display appropriate messages
