## 🔧 **System Architecture Highlights**

### **Intelligent Connection Management**
```javascript
// Network Quality Adaptation
Response Time → Network Quality → Adaptive Timeout
< 200ms      → excellent       → 10 seconds
< 500ms      → good            → 15 seconds  
< 1000ms     → fair            → 20 seconds
< 3000ms     → poor            → 30 seconds
> 3000ms     → very_poor       → 45 seconds
```

### **Progressive Loading Sequence**
```
1. Initialize (10%) → Core UI components load instantly
2. Connect (25%)    → Establish server connection with retries
3. Services (60%)   → Health checks, keep-alive activation
4. Ready (100%)     → Full functionality available
```

### **Session Persistence Strategy**
```javascript
// Automatic session restoration
sessionData = {
    sessionId: 'session_timestamp_random',
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    connectionInfo: { state, networkQuality, lastHealthCheck },
    queuedRequests: [...pendingRequests]
}
```
