We have attempted to make each section reflect our character, our spirit, as well as the operational aspects of our business.\nWe are grateful to have you here. We are here to support \nyou in delivering our mission to every customer, every day.\nWelcome to our Family!  Sincerely,Sean Bauer & George Saliba\nBauer Food LLC\nBauer Food LLC is run by Sean Bauer \nand George Saliba. Two great friends \nwho both started as crew at McDonald\u2019s \na long, long time ago. After all these years, they\u2019re still Lovin\u2019 It!\n3Who\u2019s the \u201cyou\u201d in \u201cyour\u201d? Most likely it\u2019s \nthe customer. It could also be another crew member, manager, a vendor, \nour corporate partners, or community \npersonnel like the police, fire, and health dept. In short, \u201cyour\u201d means anyone and everyone that comes\nto our restaurant!\n4QUALITY: Doesn\u2019t having a hot fresh amazing tasting meal with a \nfriend make your day better? That\u2019s why Quality of the food that we \nserve is extremely important.\nSERVICE: Does fast Service with a smile make your day better? \nAbsolutely!\nACCURACY: If you order and pay for something, but you don\u2019t get \nit or get something different, does that make your day better? Almost \ncertainly not, that\u2019s why we must make sure to provide Accurate orders.\nCLEANLINESS: How about eating in a Clean environment that \nsmells good and makes you feel good about the food you\u2019re eating? \nDirty stores definitely don\u2019t make people\u2019s days better.\nFOOD SAFETY: If the food you eat makes you ill, it most certainly \nmakes your day worse, not better, therefore being careful to ensure Safe Food is prepared is a critical priority.\n\n5When you hear about world changing companies, you often \nhear about companies like Google or Apple, but what about McDonald\u2019s? Can we make the world a better place?\nCONSIDER THIS:\nGoogle employs about 72,000 people and Apple employs 47 ,000 people. McDonald\u2019s employs over 1.5 Million people, more than 30 times the number of employees at Apple. From an employment perspective, we have a much greater opportunity to make lives better than Google and Apple combined.\nMcDonald\u2019s feeds 68 million people each day. Your individual restaurant has \nabout 500,000 visits a year! Do you make an impact in those people\u2019s lives each day? Absolutely!\nWhat do you think would make the world better? If everyone looked at their \nphone more, or if everyone had a great meal with a smile and a face to face conversation with a friend?\nIf we can make each customer\u2019s visit happy by giving them a great tasting meal \nwith fast, friendly service, in a clean restaurant, then we will make their day better.\nIn turn, they will be happier and more friendly to the people they come in \ncontact with the rest of the day (think about how you feel after a great meal served by nice people).\nAnd so on. What happens when 68 million people each day are happier and \nnicer because of how we treated them? Right, a better world. We can make a difference with every customer we serve, every burger we make, and every floor we clean. You CAN change the world, one customer visit at a time.\n6\nSmile and greet people. \u201cKindness \nis a gift everyone can afford to give\u201d\n\u201cA positive attitude leads to \npositive outcomes\u201d\nBe here on time every day, \u201c90% \nof success is showing up\u201d\n\u201cDo what you do so well \nthey will want to see it \nagain, and bring their \nfriends\u201d \u2014 Walt Disney\n7Taking care of the people who take care of our customers is one of your management team\u2019s \ntop priorities. After all, it makes good business sense to treat our employees as well as we want them to treat our customers.

And thousands more of today\u2019s top executives in companies across the U.S. also had their best work experience and developed valuable career skills in McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\nIf you show a flair for an interest in management and people supervision, you should begin \nthinking about longer-term career opportunities at McDonald\u2019s. A typical career path could look like this:\nCREW \n\u00bb CREW TRAINER/BEVERAGE SPECIALIST \u00bb FLOOR SUPERVISOR \u00bb \nSWING MANAGER \u00bb DEPARTMENT HEAD \u00bb GENERAL MANAGER\n9BENEFITS\nFollowing are some of the added benefits to working at McDonald\u2019s.\n\u2022 Meal Policy:  One of the best benefits of working for McDonald\u2019s is the food. You may \nhave the food of your choice up to the amount of $7 .00 on your break free of charge. When \nordering during your break, all employees should go and get in line as if they were a customer. Any and all employee meals must be consumed on the premises. \n\u2022 Breaks: Breaks will be provided depending on your work hours. Breaks range from a quick \npause for something to drink to a 35 minute lunch break. State law and the number of hours you work will dictate the length of your break. While on break, you will not be permitted to be on the floor or behind the front counter. If an employee wishes to decline a break, a waiver must be signed.\n\u2022 Funeral Leave: If a member of your immediate family should die, you will be paid for the \nscheduled working hours on the day of the funeral. Your immediate family includes your spouse or spouse\u2019s mother or father, grandparents, sister, brother, son, or daughter, mother or father, or step equivalent.\n\u2022 Leaves of Absence: If you find you must temporarily leave active employment at this \nMcDonald\u2019s because of school obligations, travel or other reasons, you may request a leave of absence, which your management team will consider. Full details are available through your management team.\n\u2022 Medical/Disability Leave: Our medical/disability leave policy is subject to the guidelines \nset forth in the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Under that federal law, if you have worked for the company for one year, and worked 1,250 hours during that year, you are entitled to up to 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave for the purpose of (1) taking care of yourself or a member of your immediate family when that person is suffering from a serious illness, (2) taking maternity or paternity leave, or (3) adopting a child. This 12-week period will be offset by your existing vacation or sick leave entitlement. For instance, if you are seriously ill, and have 2 weeks vacation time coming, you must first exhaust your 2 weeks vacation. After that, you will be entitled to up to 10 more weeks in that year of unpaid FMLA leave as described above. During this 12-week period, we will hold your job, or a substantially similar job, and assign it back to you until your return. Your health insurance coverage will also continue during this 12-week period. Your share of the premium payments will be do on the 1st of the month, each month until employee returns from leave. There will be a 30-day grace period in which to make premium payments.  If payment is not made timely, your group health insurance may be cancelled.  However, after you have exhausted 12 weeks of sick leave in any given year, management reserves the option to terminate your employment, at which time your medical insurance coverage and other benefits will cease. At that point, you would be eligible for continued medical coverage at your expense through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). \nFurther details of the FMLA are contained in a posting on the wall in the Crew Room. If you \nhave any other questions about the applicability of the FMLA, please contact your manager.\n10If you have not been employed by the company long enough to be eligible for coverage \nunder the FMLA, the company may, in its sole discretion, grant an unpaid leave of absence for medical or other reasons. \n\u2022 Transfers: Under certain circumstances, we may request that you transfer to another restaurant, \nin your area, on a temporary or permanent basis to meet an operating need in that restaurant.\n\u2022 Realistic Work Week\nVERIFICATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES\nEffective January 1, 2014, if you are requesting verification of employment/wages, we now \nrequire a seven business day notice to complete any form.\nAny form that is given to a member of management is placed inside a weekly folder that is \ndelivered to the office on Monday\u2019s each week. Please be aware that unless you fax the form directly to the office, we will not see anything until Monday of each week.\nAll forms are directly faxed back to the offices that are requesting the information. We do not \ngive any type of forms that verify employment or wages back to the employee directly.  \nAlso, if you require a copy of a paycheck stub, there will be a $5.00 charge on your next \npaycheck. Everyone receives a paycheck stub on scheduled pay dates, and reprinting them is a cost to our Company. Please keep these in a safe place if you know you\u2019ll need them for future reference.

In support of this commitment, we have set an absolute standard of \u201czero tolerance\u201d of illegal drugs and alcohol and their effects in the workplace serve to assert and maintain our reputation as a reasonable and prudent business concerned with the safety and welfare of our employees, customers, and the public.\n\u2022 Use, sale or possession of illegal drugs, alcohol, or being under the influence thereof while \neither on company property or while performing work on behalf of McDonald\u2019s.\n\u2022 No alcohol whether opened or unopened is permitted on company premises.\u2022 See Bauer Food LLC Substance Abuse Policy.\n21SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY\nBauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment \nfor its employees and customers. For this reason, Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s has a zero tolerance policy against on-the-job substance abuse, whether in the form of alcohol or illegal drug abuse. The details of this policy are set forth below:\nPOLICY\n1. Employees may not possess, sell trade or offer for sale alcohol, illegal drugs or other \ncontrolled substances, or otherwise engage in the illegal use of such alcohol, drugs or controlled substances on the job.\n2. Employees may not report to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or other \ncontrolled substances, or be under such influence at any time during the workday.\n3. Notwithstanding the above, employees may take properly prescribed prescription \ndrugs while on the job, unless taking the medicine will adversely affect the ability of the employee to safely perform his/her job. Prior to reporting to work, the employee should consult his/her prescribing physician as to any adverse side effects of the medicine, and relay the physician\u2019s response to his/her supervisor. Management will then make the decision as to whether the employee should be allowed to work, or be sent home.\n4. This policy applies to managers as well as employees of Bauer Food LLC  McDonald\u2019s.\nDRUG TESTINGBauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s store management shall perform drug and alcohol testing of \nany of its employees and managers in the following circumstances:\n1. Post-accident: Whenever the individual is involved in an on-the-job accident, whether or not it results in personal injury to him/herself or his/her co-workers, or results in property damage.\n2. For Reasonable Cause: Whenever an individual is behaving in such a manner or appears \nin such a way that gives management any reason to believe that the individual is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or other controlled substances. The decision to test shall be according to the discretion of the individual\u2019s immediate supervisor after he/she has consulted with the store manager.\nDRUG TESTING PROCEDURES\n1. The individual in question will be directed to report to a local testing facility specifically designated by Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s for the purpose of submitting a urine or blood sample for analysis.\n2. Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s will provide to the individual transportation to and from \nthe testing facility.\n3. The individual shall not be required to submit to a drug or alcohol test without his/her \n22consent. However, as a condition of continued employment, it is hereby understood that \neach employee or manager consents in advance to such alcohol and/or drug testing. Failure to promptly consent to or permit such tests at Bauer Food LLC  McDonald\u2019s request shall be grounds for immediate termination.\n4. As a further condition of continued employment, it is hereby understood that the employee or manager agrees in advance to release Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s from any claim he/she may have in connection with giving the urine or blood samples, the analysis of the samples by the testing agent, and the communication of the test results from the testing agent to Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s.\n5. Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s shall relay to the individual the findings of the testing \nagent as soon as possible after it receives them. Should there be a positive test result; the employee will be given an opportunity to advise \n6. Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s that the positive result was due to prescription medicines \nthat he/she had been properly taking. Based on that individual\u2019s input, Bauer Food LLC McDonald\u2019s shall, in consultation with the testing agent, determine whether the positive result was due to the presence of properly prescribed prescription drugs in the individual\u2019s system.\n7 . A positive test result that cannot be attributed to the presence of prescription drugs \nshall result in the individual\u2019s immediate termination.\n8. Such a positive result may also jeopardize the individual\u2019s claim for worker\u2019s \ncompensation benefits, should he/she be injured as result of the drug or alcohol use.\n\n23It\u2019s important to know that McDonald\u2019s is committed to serving its communities\u2019 changing \nneeds. As the largest restaurant business system, with an extremely high public awareness, we are often looked to for leadership on issues which directly and indirectly relate to our reputation.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll cover six issues, which are important to our customers and us:\n\u2022 Environment\n\u2022 Nutrition\u2022 Working Students\u2022 Labor Laws\u2022 Who You Will Need to Know\u2022 Career Opportunities\nMCDONALD\u2019S AND THE ENVIRONMENT\nWe believe we have a special responsibility to protect our environment for future generations. \nThis responsibility comes from our unique relationship with millions of customers worldwide whose quality of life tomorrow will be affected by how we guard the environment today. We share their belief in their right to exist in an environment of clean air, clean earth and clean water.\nWe look at every part of our business to determine its impact on the environment, and take \naction beyond what is expected if we feel those actions will help leave future generations an environmentally sound world.\n\n24Our environmental commitment and activities are guided by the following principles:\n\u2022 Effectively managing solid waste: We are committed to taking a \u201ctotal lifecycle\u201d approach \nto solid waste. We look at ways to reduce materials used in production and packaging, as well as diverting as much waste as possible from the solid waste stream. In doing so, we will follow three courses of action: reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\u2022 Conserving and protecting natural resources: We will continue to take aggressive \nmeasures to minimize energy and other resource consumption through increased efficiency and conservation. We will not permit the destruction of rainforests for our beef supply.  This policy is strictly enforced and closely monitored.\n\u2022 Reduce: We will take steps to reduce the weight and/or volume of the packaging we \nuse. This may mean eliminating packaging, adopting thinner and lighter packaging, changing manufacturing and distribution systems, adopting new technologies, or using alternative materials. We will continue to search for materials that are environmentally preferable.\n\u2022 Reuse: We will implement reusable materials whenever feasible within our operations and \ndistributions systems as long as they do not compromise our safety and sanitation standards, customer expectations, nor are offset by other environmental or safety concerns.\n\u2022 Recycle: We are committed to the maximum use of recycled materials in constructing, equipping \nand operating our restaurants. We are already the largest user of recycled paper in our industry, applying it to tray liners, napkins, Happy Meal boxes, carry out bags and carry out trays.\nFinally, we are committed to timely, honest and forthright communications with our customers, \nshareholders and employees regarding all of our environmental policies. We will continue to seek the counsel of experts in the environmental field. By maintaining a productive, ongoing dialogue, we will learn from them and move closer to doing all we can to preserve the environment.

A doctor\u2019s note indicating you are healthy will be required in order to return to work.\nMCDONALD\u2019S AND NUTRITION\nSince McDonald\u2019s opened its first restaurant in 1955, the company has always responded to the changing needs and tastes of our customers. We should all feel proud of the food we serve and be aware of the significant gains we continue to make in the nutrition area.\nIt\u2019s important to understand and to share with your customers that McDonald\u2019s food can \nfit into any well-balanced diet. The key word is balance, and it has led to many of our menu additions, such as salads and all-vegetable frying oil. Refer your customers to the nutrition and ingredient information guide. We are the first company in our industry to make this information available to our customers. McDonald\u2019s is committed to developing new menu items to offer our customers the taste and nutrition variety they want.\n25MCDONALD\u2019S AND WORKING STUDENTS\nWith more than 34,000 restaurants worldwide, McDonald\u2019s is one of the country\u2019s largest \nemployers of young people. Along with this leadership comes an important responsibility:  To see that education and school work are the top priorities of our school age employees and to make sure that their job experience complements, rather than detracts from, their education.\nWe subscribe to the following principles in our restaurants:\u2022 Education is a significant priority. There is no question that, between education and \nemployment, education comes first.\n\u2022 To make sure that education comes first, McDonald\u2019s provides flexible working hours to \naccommodate classes, homework assignments, and extracurricular activities.\n\u2022 Excessive or late working hours should never compromise grades and school attendance.\u2022 McDonalds provides training, skills development, and a work experience, which teaches the \nimportance of responsibility, self-discipline and superior achievements.\n\u2022 We take a leadership role in working with parents, educators and students on education issues.\u2022 McDonald\u2019s believes in supporting education by recognizing our employee\u2019s scholastic \nachievements through various scholarship opportunities.\n\u2022 McDonald\u2019s complies with all laws concerning the employment of minors and continues \nto commit to policies which go beyond local requirements.

It is important that Management uses counseling for performance problems and non-flagrant policy issues. These counseling sessions should be documented.\nIn cases where minor or less serious policy violations occur, we will normally take the \nfollowing steps:\nFirst Violation: Verbal Warning (Documented), active for 12 months.Second Violation: Written Warning (Documented), active for 12 months. This warning must \nbe reviewed and signed by your Store Manager.Third Violation: Written Warning (Documented) and Termination.In situations where serious offenses have occurred, or are suspected to have occurred (theft, \nunlawful acts, gross misbehavior, intoxication, sexual harassment, insubordination, etc.) it may be necessary to use an investigation period.\nDuring this investigation period, you may be unscheduled. This will be considered a suspension \npending investigation.\nAt the conclusion of this investigation, a disciplinary determination will be made. Depending \nupon the results of the investigation, prior work history, and the severity of the offense(s), the disciplinary action will range from a warning to a one (1) or two (2) week unpaid suspension to a termination. Each situation will be reviewed by the Manager, Supervisor, and Owner/Operator.\nIf, at the conclusion of an investigation, you are absolved of any wrong doing, you will be re-\ninstated with back pay for any missed work during the suspension period.",

But \nour impact doesn\u2019t begin and end \nwith the number of Big Macs, \nVeggie Wraps or coffees we sell. It \ngoes so much further than that. It \nis in the 2.1 million jobs that \nMcDonald\u2019s, and our franchisees, \nhave created in the past 45 years, \nthe \u00a335.6 billion we have spent \nwith UK businesses and the \u00a354.4 \nbillion we have contributed to the \nUK economy !\nGood food\nWe now spend almost \u00a31 billion \neach year on our food and supply \nchain in the UK.

However, they may not speak up because they would feel \ndisloyal or they may be worried about harassment or victimisation.\nOur whistleblowing procedure provides safeguards for employees \nwho raise concerns about malpractice in connection with the \ncompany .

On these occasions, we\u2019ll usually \ngive you a caution, write up some actions and support you to \nimprove .\nFormal disciplinary action\nIf an issue is serious or your manager thinks it\u2019s not appropriate to \nuse informal coaching and advice, we\u2019ll move into a formal \ndisciplinary process. \nThe disciplinary procedure comprises two phases, the \ninvestigation meeting and the disciplinary meeting. You may be \nsuspended whilst the investigation takes place.\nThe purpose of the investigation meeting is to gather all of the \ninformation, but not to come to any conclusions or make any \ndecision. The purpose of the disciplinary meeting is to review all of \nthe information, possible disciplinary outcomes and make a \ndecision.\nDepending on the outcome of the disciplinary , the seriousness of \nthe behaviour and whether you already have a live disciplinary \nwarning, there are various levels of action we can take:\n\uf0a7Caution / Reprimand\n\uf0a7First Written Warning\n\uf0a7Final Written Warning\n\uf0a7Demotion\n\uf0a7Dismissal\nTo read our full disciplinary procedure, please click here .This also \nincludes examples of misconduct which may lead to disciplinary \naction.\nAppeals\nIf you are dissatisfied with any formal disciplinary action taken, \nyou have the right to appeal against it by writing to the People \nServices Helpdesk within 14 days of any decision. Appeals may be \nraised on a number of grounds, which could include perceived \nunfairness of the action, the severity of the sanction, new \ninformation coming to light or procedural irregularities.

Grievances\nFrom time to time, our people \nmay have problems or \nconcerns about their work, \nworking environment or \nworking relationships that \nthey wish to raise and have \naddressed.\nThe first thing you should try is \ntalking to your manager to see \nif they can help you sort the \nproblem. But if that doesn\u2019t \nwork, you can raise a formal \ngrievance. \nThe formal grievance \nprocedure is outlined here . \nDon\u2019t worry all grievance \nproceedings and \ndocumentation will be kept \nconfidential. \nDisciplinary \nprocedure for \nperformance\nIf the issue is to do with \nperformance rather than your \nconduct, we\u2019ll follow the \nPerformance Improvement \nProcess.

For most members this will be age \n65.   For those who are members of our Stakeholder Scheme with \nAviva, the default retirement age is 65 but this can easily be changed \nby contacting Aviva.

This pension will be calculated in the same \nway as on normal retirement but by reference to your completed \npensionable service and final pensionable salary at your date of \nleaving us. It\u2019ll then be increased during the period from leaving up to \nyour 65th birthday as required by law. Such increases are designed \nto keep pace to some extent with price inflation .\nTransfer Value\nA transfer payment can be made to the pension arrangement of \nyour new employer or a personal pension plan, provided they satisfy \ncertain conditions. The transfer payment made is calculated as \nbeing equivalent in value to your benefits retained in the Scheme. \nThis calculation is carried out on a basis agreed by our Trustees after \ntaking advice from the Scheme\u2019s Actuary, and will comply with \ncurrent legislation.\nA statement showing your deferred benefit will be sent \nautomatically to your home address within eight weeks of leaving \nus. If you wish to consider a transfer of benefits, please contact \nWillis Towers Watson, details below. You\u2019ll then be provided with a \n\u2018Statement of Entitlement\u2019 setting out the transfer payment \navailable at that time. \nHow is my pension calculated?\nThis\u2019ll be calculated as 1/60th of your final pensionable salary for \nevery year of your pensionable service. Pensionable salary is \ndetermined on 6 April each year as a rate of your base salary at the \ntime. Final pensionable salary is the highest of your last three \npensionable salaries. Pensionable service is the number of years \nyou\u2019ve contributed to the Scheme, together with any additional \nperiods of service granted from a transfer payment received from \nanother pension arrangement. Completed months of pensionable \nservice will count proportionately. \nWhat should I do if I need advice on pensions?\nThe helpline at Willis Towers Watson on 01737 788125 can help with \nqueries about the pension scheme itself. You can also email them at \nmcsadmin@towerswatson.com or  login to the member portal at\nhttps://epa.towerswatson.com/accounts/mcs/ \nIf you want specific financial advice you will need to arrange this \nyourself.

Failure to follow this instruction may result in\nserious electrical shock.\nDO NOT remove the door, beater, scraper\nblades, drive shaft or air/mix pump unless all control\nswitches are in the OFF position. Failure to follow\nthis instruction may result in severe personal injury\nfrom hazardous moving parts.\nThis machine is designed to operate indoors, under\nnormal ambient temperatures of 70\u00b0-75\u00b0F\n(21\u00b0-24\u00b0C). The machine has successfully\nperformed in high ambient temperatures of 104\u00b0F(40\u00b0C) at reduced capacities.\nNOISE LEVEL: Airborne noise emission does not\nexceed 70 dB(A) when measured at a distance of\n1.0 meter from the surface of the machine and at a\nheight of 1.6 meters from the floor.Refrigerant\n______________________________\nTaylor Company uses R404A refrigerant. This\nrefrigerant is generally considered non-toxic and\nnon-flammable; however, any gas under pressure is\npotentially hazardous.\nNEVER fill any refr igerant cylinder\ncompletely with liquid. Filling the cylinder toapproximately 80% will allow for normal expansion.\nRefrigerant liquid sprayed onto the skin may\ncause serious damage to tissue. Keep eyes and skin\nprotected. If refrigerant burns should occur, flush\nimmediately with cold water. If burns are severe,\napply ice packs and contact a physicianimmediately.\nThe Taylor Company reminds technicians to be\ncautious of government laws regarding\nrefrigerant recovery, recycling, and reclaiming\nsystems.

However, due to\nthe Montreal Protocol and the U.S. Clean Air ActAmendments of 1990, many new refrigerants are\nbeing tested and developed; thus seeking their way\ninto the service industry. Some of these new\nrefrigerants are being advertised as drop-in\nreplacements for numerous applications. It should\nbe noted that, in the event of ordinary service to this\nmachine\u2019s refrigeration system, only the refrigerantspecified on the affixed data label should be used.\nThe unauthorized use of alternate refrigerants will\nvoid your compressor warranty. It will be the owners\u2019\nresponsibility to make this fact known to any\ntechnicians they employ.It should be noted, that Taylor does not warrant the\nrefrigerant used in its equipment. For example, if therefrigerant is lost during the course of ordinary\nservice to this machine, Taylor has no obligation to\neither supply or provide its replacement either at\nbillable or unbillable terms. Taylor does have the\nobligation to recommend a suitable replacement if\nthe original refrigerant is banned, obsoleted, or no\nlonger available during the five year warranty of the\ncompressor.\nThe Taylor Company will continue to monitor the\nindustry and test new alternates as they are being\ndeveloped. Should a new alternate prove, through\nour testing, that it would be accepted as a drop-in\nreplacement, then the above disclaimer would\nbecome null and void. To find out the current status\nof an alternate refrigerant as it relates to your\ncompressor, call the local Taylor Distributor or theTaylor Factory.

Brush cleaning is the\nnormal disassembly and cleaning procedure found in\nthe Operator Manual. Failure to follow these\nguidelines will cause the control to lock the freezer\nout of the AUTO mode.\nAlways comply with local guidelines for the\nmaximum number of days allowed between brush\nclean cycles. (See the M anager/Service Menu for\nsetting the Brush Clean interval, on page 21.)\nIf the Heat Treatment Cycle fails, the VFD will\ndisplay a failure message and return the freezer tothe STANDBY mode. A \u201clock\u201d is defined as a special\nSTANDBY mode of operation which does not allow\nthe machine to operate in the AUTO mode.\nThere are two types of freezer lock conditions that\ncan occur: Hard Lock or Soft Lock. A Hard Lock\nrequires the machine be disassembled and brushcleaned. A Soft Lock can be corrected by eitherdisassembling and brush cleaning the machine, orby starting another heat treatm ent cycl e.\nHard Lock: There are two causes of a hard lock\nfailure:\n1.

When this has been accomplished,the temperatures must then be returned to a\ntemperature low enough and quickly enough to\nretard spoilage.\nThe Heat Treatment Cycle must be successfully\ncompleted at least once every 24 hours or thefreezer will automatically lock itself in the STANDBYmode.\nSingle freezing cylinder operation is now available.\nThe software keeps track of the freezing cylinder(s)\n\u201cin use\u201d. Therefore, the Heat Treatment Cycle can\nnow be performed on only one side, if the other side\nhas not been placed in AUTO or STANDBY since\nthe unit was last brush cleaned.\nThe Heat Treatment Cycle may be started\nautomatically according to the AUTO HEAT CYCLETIME.\nIMPORTANT: The freezer must be operating in\neither the STANDBY or AUTO mode before a Heat\nTreatment Cycle can be started.\nThere are three phases in a Heat Treatment Cycle:\nHeat, Hold and Cool.\nThe Heat Phase\nDuring this phase, the temperatures of the product\nin the freezing cylinder and hopper are raised over\n151.5 _F( 6 6 _C) in 90 minutes or less.\nThe Heat Phase Timer \u201ctimes out\u201d the maximum\nallowable amount of time the unit can remain in theHEAT phase of the Heat Treatment Cycle.

The unit must complete this phase in less\nthan 120 minutes.\nThe COOL Phase Timer measures the maximum\nallowable time the unit can remain in the COOLphase. If the timer exceeds 120 minutes, the unit willlock-out.\nThe Heat Cycle TT (Total Time) Timer \u201ctimes out\u201d\nthe maximum allowable time the unit can remain inthe Heat Treatment Cycle (4 hours).

During theCOOL phase, the glycol and freezing cylinderproduct are refrigerated by the use of the machine\u2019smain refrigeration system.\nAt the start of the HEAT phase the glycol heater\nbegins to overcome the cold freezing cylindertemperature and the glycol temperature raisesslowly to 178 _F( 8 1 _C).\nThe purpose of the HEAT phase is to raise the\nproduct temperature above 150 _F( 6 5 _C) within 90\nminutes. To satisfy the c ontrol system, the product\nmust actually reach 151.5 _F( 6 6 _C). This\nrequirement ensures that the 150 _F( 6 5 _C)\nrequirement has been met. Health laws require\nthese parameters to be 150 _F( 6 5 _C) in 90 minutes;\nhowever, the actual amount of time the freezer takesto accomplish this requirement is closer to 60minutes.Once the HEAT Phase is complete, it is necessary\nto complete the Heat Soak Timer. From the time theHeat Phase is started, 115 minutes must transpirebefore the cool phase may enter. Due to theimplementation of the Heat Soak Timer, the Heat\nCycle Data Screen will now refer to the HOLD phase\nas the \u201cOVER\u201d phase.\nWhile in the COOL phase, the beater motor and the\nmain refrigeration syst em operate continuously until\nthe machine first cycles o ff. For the remainder of the\nCOOL phase, the beater motor and compressor\noperate from a timed cycl e. The timed cycle a llows\nthe beater motor to stop for two minutes and thenrun for six seconds. During the six seconds that thebeater motor is on, if the viscosity is below setpoint,\nthe compressor is turned on. When viscosity is\nsatisfied, the compressor and the beater are turnedoff. The timed cycle cont inues in this manner until\nthe COOL phase is complete.\nFigure 81Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n35 Model C602 Systems, Controls and OperationsTimers\nTwo Minute Stir Cycle\nIf either side of the machine is in the STANDBY\nmode, the beater motor for that side will turn on forsix seconds every two minutes.\nIf any hopper is above the cut-in temperature, the\nbeater stir cycl e timer is activated.\nSoft Serve - If the machine is in the HEAT mode,\nthis two minute stir cycl e will continue until the\nfreezing cylinder temperature rises above 135 _F\n(57_C).

For furt her understanding, see the Glycol\nPath diagram at the end of this chapter.\nThe glycol system serves two purposes. During the\nSTANDBY and AUTO modes, the glycol is used to\ncool the mix hoppers. During the HEAT mode, the\nglycol is used to heat the mix in the hopper(s) andfreezing cylinder(s).\nGlycol is a heat transfer medium made up of 50%\nethylene glycol and 50% distilled water.\nNote: It is factory recommended to drain, flush and\nre-supply a fresh glycol mixture on a two-yearmaintenance schedule.\nStandby and Auto\nDuring a refrigeration mode, the freezing cylinders\nare cooled using refrigerant, and the product iscontrolled by viscosity during the AUTO mode andby temperature during the STANDBY mode.\nThe hoppers are cooled in the following manner:When a hopper temperature reaches the cut-in\npoint, the glycol pump, solenoid valve, and beater\nstir cycle are all activated.\nThe glycol lines go (in order) through the heater,\nthrough the solenoid valve, around the freezingcylinder, and then to the hopper. In other words, the\nglycol is cooled directly by the freezing cylinder walls\nand is then pumped to the hoppers to cool the mix.Each hopper has one thermistor probe and canfunction independently.\nNote: The heater is OFF during refrigeration\nmodes.\nIn each hopper, there is an agitator paddle which is\nused to distribute the heat or cold evenly throughout\nthe mix so the mix does not freeze or burn on the\nsides of the hopper. It runs continuously when thefreezer is in the AUTO, STANDBY or HEAT mode.The agitator is driven by a motor and belt(s).The Heat Treatment Cycle\nDuring the heating phase the heater is activated. For\nshake application, beater agitation will continue until\nthe compressor cycles off. For soft serveapplication, the beater will agitate for six secondsevery two minutes until the freezing cylinder productrises above 135 _F( 5 7 _C).\nDuring the HEAT phase, all refrigeration is\ncancelled, and the glycol will heat the freezingcylinder(s) and the hopper(s) to the settemperatures.\nWARNING: Ethylene glycol is very\nharmful to your health. Swallowing glycol is\nfatal. Refer to M.S.D.S. Guidelines.\nNote: If the glycol is purchased from the factory, it\nis pre-mixed and ready to use. Otherwise, glycolshould be mixed with distilled water in a ratio of 50%glycol and 50% distilled water.\nInstalling the Glycol Mixture\nStep 1\nAttach a hose (capable of depressing the shraeder\nvalve) to the 1/4\u201d flare fitting located beneath theaccumulator tank. Remove the cap from theaccumulator and place the opposite end of the hoseinto the accumulator tank.\nStep 2\nUsing a pair of pliers, squeeze the tube locatedbetween the access fitting and the tube that leads tothe bottom of the glycol accumulator tank.\nStep 3\nFill the accumulator tank 2/3 full.\nStep 4\nRemove the necessary panels to expose the shakeinterface board. Locate the test pins marked, \u201cW2,W3, W4, and W5\u201d. Place a two pin jumper on the\ntest pins marked \u201cW4\u201d. The jumper will activate the\nglycol pump and open the glycol solenoids (ifapplicable). The glycol existing in the accumulatorwill be pumped through th e glycol system.Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n38 Systems, Controls and Operations Model C602Step 5\nMonitor the level of glycol mixture in the tank and tobe sure all air pockets are removed, continue to addmore as necessary to maintain a 2/3 full level. Allow\nthe unit to operate for a short period of time. Once\nthe service hose starts to empty glycol back into theaccumulator tank, the system is properly filled.\nRemove the jumper from the pins marked, \u201cW4\u201d.\nRelease the pliers.\nStep 6\nRemove the service hose and replace the cap onthe 1/4\u201d flare fitting. Replace the accumulator tankcap.\nStep 7\nCheck for glycol mixture leaks.\nReplenishing the Glycol Mixture\nNote: If the accumulator tank is empty, follow the\nsteps outlined in \u201cInstalling the Glycol Mixture\u201d. If theunit needs replenishing, complete the followingsteps:\nStep 1\nRemove the cap from the glycol accumulator tank.\nStep 2\nReplenish the glycol mixture until the tank is 2/3 full.\nStep 3\nReplace the cap on the accumulator.\nStep 4\nCheck for glycol mixture leaks.Draining the Glycol Mixture\nStep 1Attach a service hose (capable of depressing theshraeder valve) to the 1/4\u201d access fitting. Allow the\nopposite end of the hose to rest in an empty bucket.\nStep 2\nUsing a pair of pliers, squeeze the tube located\nbetween the access fitting and the tube leading to\nthe bottom of the glycol accumulator tank.\nStep 3\nRemove the cap from the top of the accumulatortank. The glycol will begin to flow into the bucket.\nStep 4\nRemove the necessary panels to expose the shakeinterface board. Locate the test pins marked, \u201cW2,W3, W4, and W5\u201d. Place a two pin jumper on the\ntest pins marked, \u201cW4\u201d.\nStep 5\nOnce the glycol mixture stops flowing into the\nbucket, replace the cap on the glycol accumulatortank.\nStep 6\nDisconnect the outlet line from the glycol pump.Blow air or nitrogen through the outlet line from theglycol pump. This procedure will fully drain thesystem.\nStep 7\nOnce the system is fully drained, remove the service\nhose and replace the access cap.

The\ngear unit turns the spring loaded drive coupling. Asthe product in the freezing cylinder becomes thicker,the springs collapse, and the size of the gapschange.\nAs the gaps narrow, the Hedlunds (HD\u2019s) increase.\nAs the product thickens (becomes colder) the HD\u2019sincrease. After achieving a pre-adjusted HD setting,the refrigeration cycle discontinues.\nFigure 85\nThe factory default setting for cycle off viscosity is\n4000 HD\u2019s. To adjust the serving viscosity, it may benecessary to raise or lower the HD setting. Adjust inincreases of 100 HD\u2019s at a time. Note: Be sure thatthe syrups are correctly calibrated before\ndetermining the proper serving viscosity.For standard units, the serving temperature of a\nflavored shake may range from 24 _Ft o2 6 _F\n(-4.4 _Ct o- 3 . 3 _C).\nFor Triple Thick Shake units, the serving\ntemperature may range from 22 _Ft o2 4 _F( - 5 . 6 _C\nto -4.4 _C)\nSoft Serve\nThe soft serve viscosity is measured by monitoring\nthe amperage load of the beater motor. Theamperage load of the beater motor is low when theproduct in the freezing cylinder is liquid. As theproduct freezes (thickens), the amperage load\nincreases. When the amperage load reaches the\nsetpoint, the refrigerat ion cycle di scontinues.\nThe factory default setting (setpoint) for soft serve\nviscosity is 2.8 A. The amperage measurement isdetermined by monitoring the L1 leg of power being\ndelivered to the beater motor. To adjust the serving\nviscosity, it may be necessary to raise or lower theamperage setpoint. Adjust in increases of 0.1 amp.\nThe serving temperature of soft serve product may\nvary throughout the day. The serving temperature\nmay range from 16 _Ft o1 9 _F( - 8 . 8 _Ct o- 7 . 2 _C).Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n41 Model C602 Systems, Controls and OperationsPortion Control (Shake)\nThe portion control sensor, located in the cup\nbracket, is a pyro-electric sensor which responds totemperature changes of any kind.

Ribbon cables provide the\ncommunication path between the UVC3 and the\ninterface boards.\nA 16 VAC transformer supplies the power for the\ninterface boards at Terminals A and B. Each board\nhas a 5 VDC output terminal block. Line voltage is\nconnected to the interface boards (L1 and L2) to\noperate components in the machine on command.\nThere are four sets of pins (W2,W3,W4,W5) on\neach interface board. The pins on the soft serve\nboard are inactive in the Model C602. The pins on\nthe shake interface board function as follows:\nW2 Installing a jumper resets the Brush Clean\ndate when both sides are in the OFF mode.\nW3 If the machine is in the AUTO mode,\ninstalling a jumper will simulate the viscositysetpoint.\nW4 Installing a jumper forces the start of the\nglycol pump and both left and right glycolsolenoid are energized.\nW5 If a jumper is present the real time clock can\nbe changed in any mode.\nPersonality Boards\nA Personality Board plugs into the interface board.\nThe shake proximity sensor (torque coupling sensor)and the portion control pyro-electric board harness\nare connected to the shake personality board. The\nsoft serve personality board monitors the amperage\nin one leg of power supplied to the beater motor.Control Panel Interface Board\nThe Control Panel Interface Board (Dec Plate PCB)\nis fastened to the back of the tempered glass paneland communicates with the UVC3 through a USB\ncable.\nThe control panel has two 5 VDC power leads\nsupplied to the board. One connection supplies\npower to operate the touch sensors and LED\u2019s and\nthe other 5 VDC connection provides power to\ncommunicate with the UVC3 control.\nThe Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) plugs into a\nsocket on the interface board. The potentiometer\ndial at the top of the board is non-functional. The\nVFD does not require a contrast adjustment.\nPins labeled W1 on the face of the Control Panel\nInterface Board must have a jumper installed to\nenable the audible tone when a key is selected. (W1is located next to the audible tone device, below the\n5 VDC connectors.)\nThe interface board must have the insulator installed\nto shield the circuitry on the back of the board. The\nmetal rectifier guard must be installed to shield the\ninterface board from electrical noise.\nMotor Speed Control\nThe motor speed control is powered by 5 VDC and\nreceives data bit information through a 10 pin ribbon\ncable. The speed control transmits a modulated\nsignal to the syrup motor, therefore the voltage\ncannot be accurately measured with a meter.\nThe syrup pump motors run at maximum speed in\nthe prime mode.\nThe UVC3 Control calculates the motor speed\nsetting in the syrup calibration mode and sends the\ninformation to the speed control.Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n49 Model C602 Systems, Controls and OperationsElectrical System Modes of Operation Chart\nCOMPONENT HEAT STANDBY WASH AUTO PUMP PRIME\nHeat Hold Cool\nCompressor X X X\nBeater Motor X X X X X X\nFan X X X\nSpinner Motor (Shake Only) X\nAir/Mix Pump Motor X X\nSyrup Pump X\nGlycol Heater X X\nAgitator X X X X X\nLeft Glycol Solenoid X X X X X\nRight Glycol Solenoid X X X X X\nGlycol Pump X X X X X\nShake Draw Solenoid X X X XDownloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n50 Systems, Controls and Operations Model C602Electrical System - L1 Power Path\nPower Cord Plugged In / Power Switch\nin the OFF Position\nL1 power from the power cord connection travels\nthrough the EMI filter to the 16 volt transformer.

Each syrup flavor is delivered to thedispensing door by a peristaltic pump. Syrup can be\npumped directly from disposable plastic jugs,\nstainless steel tanks, or adapted to syrup-in-bag\ndispensing. The proper syrup delivery rate is\nachieved by calibrating each syrup flavor.\nA 24 VDC motor drives each peristaltic pump. In the\nAUTO mode, the UVC3 control regulates the motor\nspeed necessary to dispense syrup at the calibratedrate. The pump motors run at maximum speed in the\nSYRUP PRIME mode.\nA relay is used to reverse the rotation of the syrup\npump motor each time the pump operation is\ndiscontinued. The syrup flow must be momentarily\nreversed in order to drop the pressure in the line and\nclose the duckbill syrup valve.\nRefer to the Motor Setup section in the Service\nMenu, page 31 for motor and reverse time settings.\nFigure 104Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n59 Model C602 Systems, Controls and Operations040608Syrup Calibration\nCalibrating the syrup flow should be performed\nweekly when the syrup syst em is cleaned. It is vital\nthat the correct amount of syrup be incorporated into\nthe frozen mix to obtain a quality shake.\nTo determine the rate of syrup flow, you will need a\ncalibration cup indicating fluid ounces. The proper\nrate of syrup flow is 1 fl. oz. (30 ml) of syrup in 5\nseconds. For Triple Thick Shake syrups, the proper\nsyrup flow rate is 1 fl. oz. +/- 1/8 fl. oz. (30 ml +/- 4\nml) in 7 seconds. Once this rate is set, the correct\namount of syrup will be blended with the shake baseregardless of the size of shake served. Please note\nthat syrup calibration is critical when changing the\npromotional 4th flavor syrup.\nCalibration Procedure\nSyrup lines must be properly primed with syrup to\neliminate air in the line before the calibrationprocedure is performed.\nStep 1\nTouch the CALIBRATION symbol to display the\nmenu options.

Failure to solve\nthe high counts will result in an unsafe product forconsumption. Educate the operator about how to\nprevent high bacteria counts.\nNote: High bacteria counts in soft serve yogurt is\nnormal and necessary. Coliform, however, cannot\nbe accepted in any product. The followinginformation will help solve high coliform countproblems.\nIf sample results indicate a problem, one of\nthese areas may be a source of contamination.\nCAUSE OF CONTAMINATION PREVENTION\n1. Human contamination. a. Wash hands and arms past elbows.\nb. Wear rubber gloves if cuts or skin conditions exist.\nc. Wash hands periodically throughout the day.\n2. Residue product deposits on mix contact surfaces\n(milkstone build-up).a. Provide the proper brushes.\nb. Brush clean all parts and components thoroughly.\nIgnoring this will allow formation of milkstone, aporous substance which will house bacteria and can\nlead to contamination of fresh mix.\n3. Worn, damaged, or cracked parts. a. Provide a food grade lubricant (Example: Taylor\nLube).\nb. Inspect o-rings for holes or tears. O-rings, seals and\nother wear items must be supplied by the freezercompany to meet food industry standards.\nc. During the operating hours, periodically inspect the\nrear drip pan for excessive leakage.Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n75 Model C602 TroubleshootingBacteria Troubleshooting (Cont\u2019d.)\nCAUSE OF CONTAMINATION PREVENTION\n4. Improper cleaning and sanitation procedures. a. For cleaning procedures, scrub the sink and strainers\nthoroughly before each use. The level of solution ineach basin must allow the largest component to be\nsubmerged. Sanitize and prime the freezer prior to\nfreezing the product. After sanitizing a freezer, use\nfresh mix to flush remaining sanitizer from the\nfreezing cylinder.\nb. Provide the proper brushes, lubricants, and single\nservice towels.\nc. Store sanitizer in a cool, dry place. Use chemicals\naccording to their labels.\nd. Use a few good employees to follow the cleaning\nprocedure correctly and consistently. Allow theemployee uninterrupted time to complete the\ncleaning procedure.\ne. Hold sanitizing solution in the hopper and the freezing\ncylinder for five minutes.\nf. Wash and sanitize the tube of lubricant; after each\nuse, always recap the tube.\ng. Parts, components, and brushes should be air-dried\novernight. Never store the equipment in the storagecooler.\nh. Do not neglect daily cleaning practices: wipe the\nexternal areas of the freezer periodically throughoutthe day, remove the design caps and sanitize the\narea, check the drip trays and splash shield.\n5. Mix stored improperly. a. Rotate stock to use older date code mix first. Shelf life\nof mix is normally 10 days.\nb. Mix must never be stacked outside or under direct\nsunlight while waiting to be placed in the cooler.\nc. Place the mix directly in the cooler. Always leave one\ninch between the mix and other products to allow airto circulate around the product.\nd. Mix must not remain at room temperature for long\nperiods of time.\ne. Hopper storage must maintain a temperature of 40 _F\n(4.4_C). Storage temperatures above 45 _F will\nallow cell division in as little as one hour.\nf. Once the mix is placed in the hopper, covers must be\nproperly installed to maintain adequate refrigerationand to prevent airborne contaminants from entering\nthe mix.Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n76 Troubleshooting Model C602Notes:Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n77 Model C602 PartsSection 4: Parts\nSWarranty Explanation\nSParts Identification\nSParts List\nSWiring DiagramsDownloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n78 Parts Model C602Parts Warranty Explanation\nClass 103 Parts: The warranty for new equipment parts is one year from the original date of unit\ninstallation, with a replacement parts warranty of three months.\nClass 212 Parts: The warranty for new equipment parts is two years from the original date of unit\ninstallation, with a replacement parts warranty of twelve months.\nClass 512 Parts: The warranty for new equipment parts is five years from the original date of unit\ninstallation, with a replacement parts warranty of twelve months.\nClass 000 Parts : Wear Items - no warranty.\nCAUTION: Warranty is valid only if required service work is provided by an Authorized Taylor Service\nTechnician.\nNOTE: Taylor reserves the right to deny warranty claims on equipment or parts if a non-approved refrigerant\nwas installed in the machine, system modifications were performed beyond factory recommendations, or\nit is determined that the failure was caused by neglect or abuse.Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n79 Model C602 PartsNotes:Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n80 Parts Model C602040608Main Exploded View\nFigure 112Downloaded from www.dlmanuals.com\n81 Model C602 PartsMain Exploded View Parts List\nITEM DESCRIPTION PART NO.\n1 SHELL A.-INSULATED X55976\n1a BEARING-REAR SHELL 031324\n1b WASHER-BEARING LOCK 012864\n1c NUT-BRASS BEARING 028991\n1d GUIDE-DRIP SEAL 028992\n2 COUPLING-DRIVE 3/4 HEX 012721\n3 SENSOR A.-EVC X44951\n4 COUPLING A.-TORQUE-SHAK X54722\n5 GEAR A.*REDUCER 4.21:1 021286-SER\n6 PULLEY-AK64-5/8 007538\n7 MOTOR-REDUCER 108RPM 044723-27S\n8 PULLEY-2AK74-5/8 027822\n9 MOTOR-REDUCER 32 RPM 036955-34S\n10 BELT-AX31 041575\n11 BELT-AX33 024396\n12 BOX-SPLICE 056677\n* COVER-SPLICE BOX 056678\n13 MOTOR A.-AGITATOR X55971-27\n13a MOTOR-AGITATOR 047987-27\n13b GEAR A.-REDUCER-AGITATOR 047988\n13c BRACKET-MOTOR-AGITATOR 056184\n13d PULLEY-AGT MTR-1.910 PD 042063\n14 CLIP-PANEL*RIGHT 056424\n15 BELT-AGITATOR 3/16 055933\n16 SHAFT A.-DRIVE-MIX PUMP X41947\n16a O-RING-1-3/4 OD X .139W 008904\n16b O-RING 1/2 ID X .139W 048632\n17PULLEY-2AK22 x .625*LEFT 016403\n17PULLEY-AK25-5/8*RIGHT 019153\n18 SCREW-5/16-18 X 7/8 HEX CAP 017973\n19MOTOR-1.0 HP*LEFT 013102-33\n19MOTOR-1.5 HP*RIGHT 021522-33\n20 CLAMP-MOUNTING 012257\n21 BUSHING-RUBBER MOUNT 012258\n22HINGE A.-MOTOR*RIGHT X25731\n22HINGE A.-MOTOR*LEFT X25736\n23 SPRING-COMP .970 X .115 025707\n24 NUT-5/16-18 MF LOCK 017327\n25 GROMMET-7/16 X 5/16 SHOCK 016212\n26 CAP-RUBBER MOUNT 011844ITEM DESCRIPTION PART NO.\n27SCREW-5/16-18 X 3-1/4 STL 022678\n27SCREW-5/16-18 X 2-1/2 HEX 002498\n28 HEATER A.-GLYCOL 4500 X55965-27\n29 FILTER A.-GLYCOL X47323\n30 PUMP A.-GLYCOL X56162-27G\n31 SHROUD-TOP 056504\n32 SCREW-10X3/8TYPEB-HWH 015582\n33 SHROUD-REAR 055943\n34 BLOWER A.
