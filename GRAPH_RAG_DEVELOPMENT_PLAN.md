## 📋 **Graph RAG Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Construction**
```
Goal: Transform document library into structured knowledge graph
Timeline: Foundation setup

Tasks:
1. Choose Graph RAG framework (LlamaIndex, LangChain, or custom)
2. Design entity schema for QSR domain
3. Extract entities and relationships from existing 15 documents
4. Build initial knowledge graph with equipment nodes
5. Validate graph structure with sample queries
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Entity Recognition**
```
Goal: Replace manual pattern matching with graph-based entity discovery
Timeline: Core functionality

Tasks:
1. Integration layer between Graph RAG and PydanticAI
2. Entity retrieval from knowledge graph
3. Context-aware entity disambiguation
4. Relationship-based entity suggestions
5. Automatic entity correction based on graph structure
```

### **Phase 3: Multi-Modal Integration**
```
Goal: Add image/video citations to step parsing
Timeline: Rich content integration

Tasks:
1. Image extraction from PDF manuals
2. Video content indexing and linking
3. Diagram recognition and citation
4. Step-to-media mapping in knowledge graph
5. Enhanced step parsing with media citations
```

### **Phase 4: Interactive Playbooks**
```
Goal: Visual step-by-step procedures with media
Timeline: UX completion

Tasks:
1. Card-based step components
2. Progress tracking and state management
3. Media display and interaction
4. Offline procedure downloads
5. Full Playbooks UX implementation
```

## 🛡️ **Safety & Rollback Strategy**

### **Rollback Points**
```bash
# Return to current stable version
git checkout main
git reset --hard v1.2.0-stable-step-parsing

# Or return to specific commits
git checkout 68e5755  # Step parsing complete
git checkout ab2115e  # General topic tracking
```

### **Development Safety**
- ✅ All work in `feature/graph-rag-implementation` branch
- ✅ Main branch preserved with working system
- ✅ Tagged rollback points available
- ✅ Incremental commits for each major component

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Parallel Testing**: Keep current system running while developing Graph RAG
- **Entity Comparison**: Test graph entities vs current pattern matching
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure Graph RAG doesn't slow down responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation if Graph RAG fails

## 🔍 **Technical Requirements Analysis**

### **Framework Selection Criteria**
- **Integration**: Works with existing PydanticAI/FastAPI stack
- **Performance**: Sub-second query response times
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ documents eventually
- **Maintenance**: Clear upgrade path and community support

### **QSR Domain Schema Design**
```python
Entities:
- Equipment (fryer, ice cream machine, grill, etc.)
- Procedures (cleaning, maintenance, troubleshooting)
- Components (heating elements, filters, sensors)
- Safety (warnings, PPE, hazards)
- Brands/Models (Taylor C602, Frymaster, etc.)

Relationships:
- Equipment → Has → Components
- Equipment → Requires → Procedures  
- Procedures → Include → Steps
- Steps → Reference → Media
- Equipment → Made_By → Brands
```

### **Success Metrics**
- **Entity Accuracy**: >95% correct entity identification
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for graph queries
- **Context Quality**: Better disambiguation than pattern matching
- **Media Integration**: Successful step-to-image/video linking

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Research & Framework Selection** (1-2 hours)
   - Evaluate LlamaIndex GraphRAG vs alternatives
   - Test with sample QSR documents
   - Assess integration complexity

2. **Proof of Concept** (2-3 hours)
   - Build minimal graph from 2-3 documents
   - Test entity extraction and queries
   - Validate performance and accuracy

3. **Integration Design** (1-2 hours)
   - Plan PydanticAI integration points
   - Design entity response structure
   - Create fallback mechanisms

4. **Incremental Implementation** (ongoing)
   - Small, testable commits
   - Parallel development with current system
   - Regular validation checkpoints

## 🔮 **Expected Outcomes**

### **Short Term (Graph RAG Foundation)**
- Automatic entity discovery from documents
- Better "ice cream machine" vs "ice machine" handling
- Relationship-aware context suggestions

### **Medium Term (Multi-Modal Integration)**
- Step-by-step procedures with relevant images
- Video citations for complex procedures
- Interactive troubleshooting trees

### **Long Term (Full Playbooks UX)**
- Visual procedure cards with progress tracking
- Offline-capable maintenance guides
- QSR-specific interactive training materials
