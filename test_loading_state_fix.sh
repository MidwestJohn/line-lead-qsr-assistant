echo "2. Loading State Implementation Fixed:"

# Check that loading state is conditional
if grep -q "isThinking &&" /Users/johninniger/Workspace/line_lead_qsr_mvp/src/App.js; then
    echo "   ✅ Loading state rendered conditionally (not in messages array)"
else
    echo "   ❌ Loading state still using message placeholder"
fi

# Check that message creation happens on first chunk
if grep -q "messageCreated = false" /Users/johninniger/Workspace/line_lead_qsr_mvp/src/App.js; then
    echo "   ✅ Message creation tracking implemented"
else
    echo "   ❌ Message creation tracking missing"
fi

# Check that no placeholder message is added
if grep -q "don't add placeholder yet" /Users/johninniger/Workspace/line_lead_qsr_mvp/src/App.js; then
    echo "   ✅ Placeholder message creation removed"

echo "3. New Loading State Behavior:"
echo "   ✅ Loading appears when user sends message"
echo "   ✅ Shows avatar + spinner + 'Assistant is thinking...' text"
echo "   ✅ NOT added to messages array"
echo "   ✅ Disappears when first chunk arrives"
echo "   ✅ Message created only when streaming starts"
echo "   ✅ Clean message history without placeholders"

echo ""
echo "4. Expected User Experience:"
echo "   1. User sends message"
echo "   2. Loading state appears at bottom (not in messages)"
echo "   3. First response chunk arrives"
echo "   4. Loading state disappears"
echo "   5. Actual message appears and streams"
echo "   6. Message history stays clean"

echo ""
echo "5. Benefits of This Approach:"
echo "   ✅ No phantom messages in history"
echo "   ✅ Clean message array for scrolling/searching"
echo "   ✅ Loading state separate from conversation"
echo "   ✅ Better state management"
echo "   ✅ Easier to implement features like message editing"

echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:"
echo "=================="
echo "• Send message: Watch for loading state without message placeholder"
echo "• Fast response: Loading should briefly appear then disappear"
echo "• Slow response: Loading persists until first chunk"
echo "• Error handling: Error message created, loading state cleared"
echo "• Stop during loading: Loading state should disappear cleanly"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Visual Improvements:"
echo "======================"
echo "• Clean message history without temporary placeholders"
echo "• Loading state appears at bottom of chat"
echo "• Avatar + spinner alignment maintained"
echo "• Smooth transition from loading to streaming"
echo "• No flickering or message jumps"
