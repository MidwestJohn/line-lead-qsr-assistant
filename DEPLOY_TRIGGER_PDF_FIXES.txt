üîç PDF PREVIEW FIXES DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER
Timestamp: 2025-06-29T03:26:30Z
Priority: CRITICAL - PDF Preview Functionality

BACKEND CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
‚úÖ HEAD endpoint for /files/{filename} - enables file accessibility checks
‚úÖ Enhanced CORS headers with HEAD method support
‚úÖ Proper Content-Disposition headers for PDF preview
‚úÖ Improved error handling and logging

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- Frontend: ‚úÖ Enhanced with comprehensive debugging
- Backend: ‚è≥ Awaiting Render deployment of HEAD endpoint
- Critical Issue: HEAD requests returning 405 (Method Not Allowed)

IMPACT:
Without HEAD endpoint support:
- File accessibility checks fail (causing PDF preview to fail)
- Frontend debugging cannot verify file access
- PDF.js cannot properly initialize document loading
- Users see infinite loading at 0%

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
‚úÖ HEAD requests return 200 with proper headers
‚úÖ File accessibility checks pass
‚úÖ PDF preview loads successfully
‚úÖ CORS configuration allows browser PDF loading

üéØ DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY TO FIX PDF PREVIEW! üéØ
