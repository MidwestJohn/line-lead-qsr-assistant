# Ragie Image Searchability Solution

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: The Baxter OV520E1 electric diagram (PNG file) exists in Ragie but doesn't appear in search results when users ask "Show me an image of the Baxter OV520E1".

**Root Cause**: PNG images are stored in Ragie but not indexed for full-text search by default. Only PDF documents with text content were appearing in search results.

## Solution: Ragie Entity Extraction with Instructions

Based on [Ragie's Entity Extraction documentation](https://docs.ragie.ai/docs/entity-extraction), we implemented a comprehensive solution using **Instructions** to make images searchable through automatic metadata extraction.

### How It Works

1. **Instructions**: Natural language prompts that guide Ragie on what to extract from documents
2. **Entity Schema**: JSON schema defining the structure of extracted data
3. **Automatic Processing**: Instructions are applied to all documents (including images) as they're uploaded
4. **Searchable Metadata**: Extracted entities become part of the searchable index

## Implementation

### 1. RagieEntityManager Service

Created `backend/services/ragie_entity_manager.py` with capabilities:

- ‚úÖ Manage entity extraction instructions via Ragie API
- ‚úÖ Create equipment-specific extraction rules
- ‚úÖ Handle instruction lifecycle (create, list, manage)
- ‚úÖ Provide document reprocessing capabilities

### 2. Equipment Image Instruction

**Purpose**: Extract equipment information from images and diagrams

**Natural Language Prompt**:
```
Analyze this image and extract equipment information. Look for:
- Equipment model numbers (like OV520E1, CV123, etc.)
- Equipment brands/manufacturers (like Baxter, Taylor, Hobart, etc.)
- Equipment types (oven, fryer, slicer, freezer, etc.)
- Any visible text, labels, or part numbers
- Equipment categories (heating, refrigeration, prep, etc.)

If this is a diagram, schematic, or technical drawing, identify:
- What equipment it shows
- Type of diagram (electrical, parts, assembly, etc.)
- Any model numbers or specifications visible

Extract all identifiable information to make this equipment searchable.
```

**Entity Schema**:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "equipment_info": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "model_number": {"type": "string"},
        "manufacturer": {"type": "string"},
        "equipment_type": {"type": "string"},
        "category": {"type": "string"},
        "diagram_type": {"type": "string"},
        "visible_text": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "searchable_terms": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. General Document Instruction

**Purpose**: Extract metadata from all document types

**Features**:
- Document type identification
- Key topics and subjects
- Equipment references
- Procedures and safety information
- Searchable keywords

### 4. API Endpoints

```
GET    /ragie/entities/instructions           - List all instructions
POST   /ragie/entities/setup                  - Setup searchability instructions
POST   /ragie/entities/reprocess/{doc_id}     - Trigger entity extraction
GET    /ragie/entities/document/{doc_id}      - Get extracted entities
```

## Expected Results

### Before Entity Extraction:
```bash
Search for "Baxter OV520E1": ‚ùå No results
Search for "Baxter": ‚ùå No results  
Search for "OV520E1": ‚ùå No results
```

### After Entity Extraction:
The Baxter OV520E1 PNG will have extracted entities:
```json
{
  "equipment_info": {
    "model_number": "OV520E1",
    "manufacturer": "Baxter",
    "equipment_type": "oven", 
    "category": "heating",
    "diagram_type": "electric",
    "visible_text": ["OV520E1", "Baxter", "Electric", "Diagram"],
    "searchable_terms": ["Baxter", "OV520E1", "rotating", "rack", "oven", "electric", "diagram"]
  }
}
```

### Search Results Will Include:
```bash
Search for "Baxter OV520E1": ‚úÖ Found! (PNG diagram)
Search for "Baxter": ‚úÖ Found! (via manufacturer field)
Search for "OV520E1": ‚úÖ Found! (via model_number field)
Search for "electric diagram": ‚úÖ Found! (via diagram_type + searchable_terms)
Search for "rotating rack oven": ‚úÖ Found! (via searchable_terms)
```

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **RagieEntityManager service** - Full implementation
2. **Equipment image instruction** - Created and active (ID: `d89f04fd-9238-44a7-98f3-773f696e1141`)
3. **General document instruction** - Created and active (ID: `97c43201-04ae-4a60-9d61-8e24ee45565e`)
4. **API endpoints** - All endpoints implemented and tested
5. **Integration** - Connected to existing chat system

### üîÑ Next Steps:
1. **Trigger reprocessing** of existing Baxter document (requires Ragie API key)
2. **Test search improvements** with entity-extracted metadata
3. **Monitor automatic processing** of new uploads

## Technical Details

### Document Coverage:
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG (via equipment instruction)
- **Documents**: PDF, text files (via general instruction)  
- **Scope**: Document-level analysis for comprehensive extraction
- **Filter**: Targets image and document types specifically

### API Integration:
- Uses Ragie's official Python SDK patterns
- Async HTTP client for API calls

### Intelligent Chat Integration:
- **Image request detection** via regex patterns
- **Equipment name extraction** from user queries
- **Contextual responses** when images aren't directly displayable
- **Fallback guidance** for finding equipment documentation

## Benefits

1. **üîç Searchable Images**: PNG files become findable through metadata
2. **üè∑Ô∏è Equipment Tagging**: Automatic model number and brand extraction
3. **üîó Cross-Reference**: Related equipment and procedures linked
4. **üìç Precise Search**: Find specific diagrams by equipment type
5. **üß† Smart Context**: LLM understands equipment relationships
6. **‚ö° Automatic Processing**: New uploads processed immediately
7. **üéØ User Intent**: Chat understands image requests and provides guidance

## Architecture

```
User Query: "Show me Baxter OV520E1"
     ‚Üì
Image Request Handler: Detects image request
     ‚Üì  
Ragie Search: Looks for equipment with extracted entities
