## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Enhanced Data Flow
```
User Query → Enhanced Orchestrator → Agent Classification → PydanticAI Agent with Ragie Tools
                    ↓                           ↓                        ↓
            Context Updates ← Agent Response ← Ragie Knowledge Search ← QSR Optimization
                    ↓                           ↓                        ↓

                    ↓
            Multi-Modal Response (Text + Images + Metadata)
```

### Integration Patterns Successfully Implemented

#### 1. **RunContext Dependency Injection**
```python
@dataclass
class QSRRunContext:
    ragie_service: EnhancedRagieService
    conversation_id: str
    equipment_context: Optional[str] = None
    procedure_context: Optional[str] = None
    visual_citations: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

#### 2. **PydanticAI Tools with Ragie Integration**
```python
@agent.tool
async def search_equipment_manual(ctx: RunContext[QSRRunContext], equipment: str) -> str:
    qsr_context = QSRContext(equipment_type=equipment.lower())
    results = await ctx.deps.ragie_service.search_with_qsr_context(query, qsr_context)
    # Coordinates visual citations with text response
```

#### 3. **Intelligent Agent Routing**
```python
# Query: "How do I clean the grill safely?"
# → Classification: Safety Agent (safety_critical=True)
# → Ragie Context: equipment_type="grill", procedure_type="cleaning", safety_level="high" 
# → Response: Safety procedures + Visual citations from grill manual
```
