# Document Deletion System

## Overview

The Document Deletion System provides complete lifecycle management for documents in the Line Lead QSR MVP. When a user deletes a PDF from the UI, this system ensures that all associated entities and relationships are properly removed from both LightRAG and Neo4j storage.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **DocumentDeletionService** - Core deletion logic
2. **Document Deletion API Endpoints** - REST API interface
3. **Neo4j Cleanup Operations** - Database maintenance
4. **LightRAG Integration** - Vector store cleanup
5. **Safety & Rollback Mechanisms** - Error recovery

## Features

### ✅ Core Functionality

- **Complete Document Removal** - Removes all traces of a document from the system
- **Shared Entity Preservation** - Entities referenced by multiple documents are preserved
- **Relationship Cleanup** - Orphaned relationships are automatically removed
- **Atomic Operations** - All-or-nothing deletion with rollback capability
- **Source Tracking** - Maintains document provenance for all entities

### ✅ Safety Features

- **Deletion Preview** - Shows what will be deleted before execution
- **Rollback Capability** - Restores data if deletion fails
- **Orphaned Entity Cleanup** - Removes entities with no document references
- **Database Consistency Checks** - Verifies integrity after operations

### ✅ API Endpoints

```
DELETE /api/v1/documents/{document_id}     # Delete document
GET    /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/preview # Preview deletion
GET    /api/v1/documents/                  # List all documents
GET    /api/v1/documents/stats            # Get statistics
POST   /api/v1/documents/cleanup/orphaned # Clean orphaned entities
POST   /api/v1/documents/reset            # Reset entire graph
```

## Usage

### Basic Document Deletion

```python
# Via API
import requests

# Preview deletion
preview = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/documents/{doc_id}/preview")
print(f"Will delete {preview.json()['entities_to_remove']} entities")

# Delete document
result = requests.delete(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/documents/{doc_id}")
print(f"Deleted {result.json()['entities_removed']} entities")
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from services.document_deletion_service import DocumentDeletionService

# Initialize service
deletion_service = DocumentDeletionService(neo4j_service, lightrag_service)

# Delete document
result = await deletion_service.delete_document("doc_123")

if result.success:
    print(f"Successfully deleted {result.entities_removed} entities")
else:
    print(f"Deletion failed: {result.errors}")
```

## Technical Details

### Entity Source Tracking

The system tracks document sources using these fields:
- `source_document_id` - Single document reference
- `source_documents` - Array of document references (for shared entities)

### Deletion Algorithm

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Identify all entities associated with the document
   - Classify entities as "remove" vs "preserve" based on sharing
   - Map relationships that need cleanup

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Create deletion plan with entities and relationships
   - Generate backup data for rollback
   - Validate operation safety

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Remove relationships first (prevent orphaned relationships)
   - Remove entities only referenced by this document
   - Update shared entities (remove document reference)
   - Remove from LightRAG storage

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Verify no entities still reference the document
   - Check database consistency
   - Confirm successful cleanup

### Shared Entity Handling

When multiple documents reference the same entity:

```python
# Entity referenced by multiple documents
entity = {
    "id": "fire_safety_001",
    "name": "Fire Safety Protocol",
    "source_documents": ["doc_fryer_001", "doc_grill_001"]
}

# When deleting doc_fryer_001:
# - Entity is NOT deleted
# - source_documents becomes ["doc_grill_001"]
# - Entity remains available for queries
```

### Error Handling & Rollback

The system provides comprehensive error handling:

```python
# Automatic rollback on failure
try:
    result = await deletion_service.delete_document(doc_id)
    if not result.success:
        # Rollback was already performed
        print(f"Rollback: {result.rollback_performed}")
except Exception as e:
    # System automatically restores from backup
    print(f"Error with automatic recovery: {e}")
```

## Data Integrity

### Atomic Operations

All deletions are atomic - either all operations succeed or all are rolled back:

```python
# This ensures consistency
async def _execute_deletion(self, deletion_plan, result):
    # Step 1: Remove relationships
    for relationship in deletion_plan['relationships_to_remove']:
        success = await self._remove_relationship(relationship)
        if not success:
            await self._rollback_deletion(backup_data)
            return False
    
    # Step 2: Remove entities
    for entity in deletion_plan['entities_to_remove']:
        success = await self._remove_entity(entity)
        if not success:
            await self._rollback_deletion(backup_data)
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Orphaned Entity Prevention

The system prevents orphaned entities through:

1. **Relationship-first deletion** - Removes relationships before entities
2. **Shared entity preservation** - Never deletes entities used by other documents
3. **Reference counting** - Tracks how many documents reference each entity
4. **Cleanup operations** - Periodic cleanup of truly orphaned entities

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Operations

For large documents with many entities:

```python
# Batch deletion for performance
async def _batch_delete_entities(self, entities, batch_size=50):
    for i in range(0, len(entities), batch_size):
        batch = entities[i:i + batch_size]
        await self._delete_entity_batch(batch)
```

### Query Optimization

Deletion queries are optimized for performance:

```cypher
-- Efficient entity lookup
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.source_document_id = $document_id 
   OR $document_id IN n.source_documents
WITH n, n.source_documents as sources
RETURN n, sources
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Comprehensive Logging

```python
# Detailed operation logging
self.logger.info(f"🗑️  Starting document deletion: {document_id}")
self.logger.info(f"📋 Deletion plan: {len(entities_to_remove)} entities")
self.logger.info(f"✅ Deletion successful: {entities_removed} entities removed")
```

### Metrics Tracking

```python
# Track deletion metrics
result = DeletionResult(
    success=True,
    entities_removed=25,
    relationships_removed=40,
    shared_entities_preserved=5,
    errors=[],
    rollback_performed=False
)
```

## Testing

### Test Suite Components

1. **Unit Tests** - `test_document_deletion.py`
2. **Integration Tests** - `demo_document_lifecycle.py`
3. **API Tests** - `run_deletion_tests.sh`
4. **Edge Case Tests** - Error handling and edge cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite
./run_deletion_tests.sh

# Run individual tests
python backend/test_document_deletion.py
python demo_document_lifecycle.py
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

```python
# TODO: Add authorization checks
@deletion_router.delete("/{document_id}")
async def delete_document(document_id: str, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Verify user has permission to delete this document
    if not await user_can_delete_document(user, document_id):
        raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient permissions")
```

### Audit Trail

```python
# TODO: Add audit logging
await audit_log.record_deletion(
    user_id=user.id,
    document_id=document_id,
    entities_removed=result.entities_removed,
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Soft Deletion** - Mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
2. **Bulk Operations** - Delete multiple documents at once
3. **Scheduled Cleanup** - Periodic orphaned entity cleanup
4. **Recovery Tools** - Restore accidentally deleted documents

### Multi-Modal Enhancement

```python
# TODO: Enhanced multi-modal deletion
async def delete_document_with_media(self, document_id: str):
    # Delete text entities
    await self._delete_text_entities(document_id)
    
    # Delete image references
    await self._delete_image_references(document_id)
    
    # Delete table/chart references
    await self._delete_structured_data(document_id)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Orphaned Relationships**
   ```bash
   # Fix orphaned relationships
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/documents/cleanup/orphaned
   ```

2. **Incomplete Deletions**
   ```python
   # Check for remaining entities
   preview = await deletion_service.get_document_preview(doc_id)
   if preview['entities_to_remove'] > 0:
       # Re-run deletion
       await deletion_service.delete_document(doc_id)
   ```

3. **Database Inconsistency**
   ```bash
   # Reset entire graph if needed
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/documents/reset
   ```

### Debug Mode

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.getLogger('services.document_deletion_service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
