As a Server, you will set the stage and have a direct impact \non each guest's experience. You will determine whether each guest feels welcom e, \nappreciated and well cared for.  \nWe will provide you with the training you need to be successful. We take great pride in our quality food and friendly, responsive service. Our high standards can only be \nmaintained through great people like you who share  our values and desire to do the very \nbest job possible for our guests every day.  \nAs a server, it is essential that you maintain an energetic, friendly and caring attitude at \nall times. It is your responsibility to see that each guest is made to feel spec ial and enjoys \nour fun atmosphere and great food and beverages.  \nThe guidelines listed on the following pages have been established to help you in your \neffort to provide these qualities to our guests. Along with the hands -on training you will \nreceive, this manual will provide answers to questions you may have regarding your tasks, responsibilities and operating procedures for Drifter\u2019s . \nOnce again, welcome to the Drifter\u2019s  Team!  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  FOH EMPLOYEE FUNCTIONS & RESPONSIBILITIES \nSuccessful sales and service result from confidence, which can only be developed \nthrough knowledge. We will provide you with ample material to develop the necessary \nknowledge and confidence in relation to service techniques, the menu and the bar. You, as a server for Drifter\u2019s , must learn it.  \n \nGeneral Job Guidelines And Responsibilities  \n1. When taking an order, always look the customer directly in the eyes, and stand \nerect. Never lean or write on the table. Never crouch down on your knees. \n2.  Never handle a glass by the rim with your hand over the drinking surface. \n3.  Never handle utensils with your hand over the eating surface. \n4.  When handling food, never let your hand touch the eating surface or the food. \n5.  Help your guests as much as possible. \n6.  Know your schedule.  \n7.  Know what time to be here for each shift. \n8.  Know what the daily specials are and what they cost. \n9.  Know the history of the restaurant and of Smith Mountain Lake (SML). \n10.  Know the managers.  \n11. Avoid any long conversations at any particular table. This will only upset your other customers. \n12. Clear your mind of everything except work when you walk in the door. When you're at the table make sure you're mind is at the table too. Guests can tell when their server is not totally mentally present with  them and can have a negative \nimpact on the guests' experience and your tip! \n13.  If you get behind, ask for assistance. You'll never get in trouble for asking. \n14.  Keep yourself geared up so that you are ready for any rush. \n15. Don't ever stand around or lean on anything. You can always be cleaning. Running clean-up, wiping shelves or the sales station, taking bus tubs to the back, etc. A server never goes into, or leaves, the kitchen empty handed. Full hands in, full hands out! \n16. Always be sure that all your food is secure when you leave the window. Never attempt to carry too much. Two safe trips are better than one catastrophe.  \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  17. Always walk quickly, but never run. This will prevent serious accidents and extra \nwork for everyone.  \n18. If an order is delayed in the kitchen, fi rst inform the manager, and then tell your \ncustomers. The manager will go to the table and explain the situation as well. Get your stories straight. Never hide from your customers.  \n19. Learn to use your time wisely. When in your station, check all the tables b efore \ngoing back to the kitchen. Don't go to one table then go to the kitchen. Consolidate your trips. Fill up all glasses in your whole station, clear all plates, and then go on to something else. This is the secret to running volume and making more money.  \n20. Always try to take out complete orders. If the entire order is ready except for a side order, like a vegetable, take out the entrees and have someone follow you in a few seconds with the side order. Don't let food get cold because of a side order. Everyt hing goes out hot. \n21. You won't believe how patient people will be if they just see you. Don't hide from your customers. If you use this method in taking orders, you will find that your food will be out more consistently on time, and you will give much better  service \nover all. You will have more time to converse with your customers. People look for more than just good service and food when they come here. They want a total dining experience. They look for that little extra personal touch which only you as their server can give them. No server ever made any money gossiping at a server \nstation.  \n22. Anytime you wait on a customer, put yourself in their place and ask yourself if you would be happy with the job you did at that table. \n23. If one person asks for something at a table, make sure you ask everyone at the table if they too would like that item. This will save you a lot of extra trips. If one person requests more tea, ask everyone at the table if they need more tea, or anything else!  \n24. Punctuality is very important. I f you get to work late, you start out behind. BE ON \nTIME.  \n25. We know that servers work for tips. All people do not realize this. If you get slighted on a tip, it may be because people think the tip is included in the bill or because they just don't like to tip. The customer is NOT required to tip. If you get stiffed, it is unfortunate, but you must take the good with the bad. Any customer feedback about an employee regarding a bad tip will not be tolerated and is grounds for immediate dismissal. \n26. NEVER SIT DOWN WITH A CUSTOMER or friend while on duty, even if they ask you to. \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  27. When waiting on parties of one, or an ace as they are called in the restaurant \nbusiness, special attention should be paid to them. They are generally in and out quicker than other parties , and they are usually the best percentage tippers.  \n28. The most neglected customer in the restaurant is the late customer. People who come in the last few minutes of the evening are usually the best tippers. They don't care how busy it was or how tired you a re. They are here to enjoy \nthemselves. Restaurants are noted for hurrying along late coming customers. We are not rushing them, but we must get their order because the kitchen is closing. They may sit there and enjoy their meal as long as they wish. Treat them as though they are the first customers of the evening. \n29. A tip should never be removed from a table while the customer is still there. Unless, however, the customer hands it to you or motions for you to come and get it.  \n30. If you are having a problem with another employee, go directly to the manager. Do not harass the employee.  \n31. If you must go to the bathroom during the shift, ask someone if they will please watch your section while you are gone, and inform a manager so that they are not looking for you. \n32. No server is to change his or her section or pick up extra tables without the \nconsent of the manager on duty. \n33. No gum chewing or smoking in front of our guests EVER. Eating snacks/lunch \nbreaks is only permitted at the bar table during slow periods.  \n34.  A sales s tation can only be opened or closed by a manager. NO EXCEPTIONS. \n35.  Serve food from customer's left.  \n36.  Serve beverage from customer's right. \n37.  Clear everything from customer's right. \n38.  Serve women and children first, then men. \n39. Whenever you serve a course, ask i f there is anything else you can do for the \ntable.  \n40. Empty baskets and dispose of all trash after each course.  \n41.  Top off with offer of additional beverages whenever anyone is getting low. \n42.  Bring condiments to the table before they are needed.  \n43.  Never walk away from a table without acknowledging its requests. \n44.  Never allow ashtrays to fill up. Cap them and change them often.   \n45.  Never assume that the change is your tip!  NEVER ASK \u201cDo you need change!!!\u201d  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  THE GUEST  \n \nNever underestimate the importance of a gues t!!! \n1. A guest is not dependent upon us -- we are dependent upon him (or her). \n2. A guest is NEVER an interruption of our work - he is the purpose of it. \n3. A guest does us a favor when he comes here -- we are not doing him a favor by \nserving him. \n4. A guest is part of our business -- not an outsider. \n5. A guest is not a cold statistic -- he is a flesh and blood human being with \nfeelings and emotions, like our own. \n6. A guest is a person who brings us his wants -- it is our job to fill those wants.  \n7. A guest is deserving of the most courteous and attentive treatment we can give him. \n8. Our guest s are the lifeblood of Drifter\u2019s . \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  SERVICE  \nDefinition of \"service\" according to Webster:  To work for. To minister to. To set on a \ntable for a meal. To manage or work. To deliver or transmit.  \nThe Problem : Webster never worked in a restaurant or took care of \"our\" guests. \nDrifter\u2019s  definition of service:   \n\"The manner in which the customer is t reated.\"  \nIf you think we are in the restaurant business, you are wrong! We are in the business of \nretail sales. We manufacture a variety of products and merchandise in our kitchen an  \nbar. Then, we offer it for sale to customers in a display service area known as countet tops, tables, and dining rooms. Unlike most retail operations, such as department stores, our product has a limited shelf life, due to potential spoilage.  \nThere is a g reater sense of urgency for selling, moving, and serving our products. Our \nRestaurant is not merely a place to eat or drink, but rather a building designed to \naccommodate, facilitate, and promote the retail sales of food and beverage to customers  \nthrough s ervice. We provide service as a way of making sales to our guests.  \n \nThe difference between a restaurant and other retail sales organizations : \n1. In a restaurant, we manufacture AND sell our product under the same roof. \n2. In a restaurant, we know our guests are here to buy, not browse (no one comes \nin to try on a burger). \n3. In a restaurant, our guests may return as many as three times a day (lunch, \nhappy hour, and dinner). Although this is unlikely, some guests may be \nregulars, day after day. No one buys the same shoes, pants, or socks three days \nin a row. \n4. Department stores provide service. Restaurants provide hospitality:  a warm feeling from feeding both the body and the soul. \n5. More entertainers open restaurants and bars than department stores. Why? Because this is showbiz! \nOur function as a Restaurant  is to acquire and maintain business, to turn casual \ncustomers into loyal, repeat guests.  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Five basics of service excellence:  \n1. Look at me. \n2. Smile at me.  \n3. Talk to me.  \n4. Listen to me.  \n5. Thank me. \n*Remember, every restaurant owes its existence to its customers .*  \nWhen a customer forms an opinion of a food establishment, service and food presentation \nstand -alone. No matter how beautiful the surroundings or how delicious the food; poor \nservice will ce rtainly ruin the entire dining experience. \nWhen developing good service, promote these qualities:  promptness, courtesy, good \nmanners, enthusiasm, and teamwork. In short, project a professional attitude. Unless you \nattain this goal, you will not be able to provide the high quality of service we expect here at Drifter\u2019s . \nEach time you service a table; our reputation rests in your hands.   \nYou have the power to influence the opinion of those people. If they are happy with you and your service, they will return. They will also recommend the restaurant to their friends. However, if they are not happy... \nIn order to be properly efficient, service people must be constantly aware of their \ncustomers' needs. Anticipate what they will want. Learn to read expressions and body \nlanguage. If a customer is frantical ly rubber necking, waving his arms, or nodding, \nchances are he needs something. The more he must ask for service, the less enjoyable his \nevening will be. The tip he leaves you will reflect his feelings. \nYou will be trained ,  \n...by our most experienced qualified people. The more attentive, enthusiastic, and patient \nyou are, the sooner you will develop the work habits which make you an excellent server, \ncapable of taking great care of our guests and be rewarded financially too.  \nServicing the public ,  \n...in any business, requires a vast amount of humility and patience. Always maintain a \nfriendly, but professional attitude. If you need help, ASK FOR IT. Even if you become an \nexcellent server, there will be times when you will get behind. Have enough \nconsideratio n for your customers, and the house, to get assistance WHEN NECESSARY. \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Remember - TEAMWORK  - no business can survive without it. We have provided \nyou with a service manual. In it we have outlined some helpful suggestions to make your \njob here more profitable and enjoyable. These are the tools of your trade. Use them \nwisely and they will help you prosper. \nArrive on time  \n\u2026for your shift properly dressed, with scrubbed hands and nails, pressed shirt, and clean \nshoes. If your appearance is sloppy, your performance will be sloppy. Your appearance, \ndress, posture, and expressions broadcast to everyone how you feel about YOU. Take pride in yourself, and others will be proud of you. \nIntroduce yourself .  \nCustomers want to know who is serving them\u2026 but it is the added personal touch they enjoy. Also, if they have enjoyed their visit, they can request your station/section  again. \nThey might even tell their friends to ask for you. Call parties are the best tippers. In this manner, you can develop a following. \nWhen people go out to eat, they want to relax.  \nThey want you to help them decide what to eat, when to order, what to drink, etc. You are there to fulfill their needs. Don't be pushy; do be confident. Often a customer is nervous. \nIt is your job to make gu ests feel comfortable, so comfortable they want to come back.  \nDon't be afraid of customers .  \n90% of the people dining out won't notice a small mistake. Be relaxed, but alert, and \nefficient. Always be in control of a situation. Be strong, yet polite. \nAlways  be yourself .  \nDevelop your own tableside manner. Avoid using repetitious phrases or seeming \"plastic.\" Your customers will know you are faking it, and they will resent your attitude. \nCustomer service turn offs : \n1.  Dirty plates in hand when greeting customers, \"Hi, ready for dessert?\"  \n2.  Not knowing what they are drinking. \n3. \"Discussion Groups\" of three or four idle servers. All discussions should be held during an approved break period. \n4.  Not acknowledging waiting guests. \n5.  Answering the phone with \"Hold please.\"  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  6. Greeting guests with a number, i.e., \"Two?\u201d instead of a smile and  \n\u201cWelcome! Will anyone else be joining you for lunch today?\"  \n7. CELL PHONES!!!!!!!!!!! \n \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  QUALITY CONTROL \nQuality control is a primary responsibility of every employee serving food and drinks to \nthe customer. You are the last person to come in contact with the food \nbefore the customer does. If something does not look right or is not presentable, DO NOT SERVE IT! The saying \"People eat with their eyes\" is very true. Make sure all  of your products look great! \n \nThings to look for before leaving the window:  \n \n1. HOT food . Few things are more basic but more important. Check to see of \nyour food is hot. Just because something is in the window, does not mean that it is hot. If it is not hot, DO NOT TAKE IT OUT. Tell the manager. NEVER yell or argue with the kitchen. Go directly to the manager. This will alleviate a \nlot of problems. \n2. C\nlean plates . Always check any plates, utensils and anything else before you \npresent them to the customer. Check food basket for grease spots, spilled food, etc. \n3. C\norrect portions . Always check to see that the product is in the right portions. \nMake sure you are taking YOUR order. This can be very embarrassing at the \ntable. Always ask yourself if you would eat tha t item if it were brought to you.  \n4. C all for back- ups. If something in the kitchen looks low and you are about to \nrun out, TELL SOMEONE. If you take one of the last salsas or sour cream, call for back -ups. If the salad is warm or wilted, do everyone a favor, and say \nsomething before the customer is served. \n5. W\nhen bringing out drinks , be certain the glass is clean, filled to the proper \nlevel, and that the garnish is correct, fresh and attractive. \n6. C old food  is as equally important as hot food. Make sure cold foods are going \nout cold, not warm or cool, but cold. \n7. B ring necessary condiments  with order: i.e., ketchup, mustard, Parmesan \ncheese, etc.  \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  8. Check back  . . . within two bites to make sure everything is perfect. Don't say, \n\"Is everything o.k.?\" Guests here this trite saying so often it's meaningless. Say \nsomething like, \"Is everything prepared to your satisfaction?  Is there anything \nelse I can get for you?\" Be specific and sincere in wanting to know the answer. \n9. I f the customer is not satisfied  . . . or there is obviously something wrong at \nthe table, i.e., wrong drink, foreign object in food, not cooked properly, etc., \nuse the following steps: \n8. Apologize. \n9. Remove the items immediately.  \n10. Get a manager. Management will take the necessary steps in making sure that the problem is corrected and that the customer is 100% satisfied. \n10. Remember, the appearance of the exterior of the building, the greeting of the \nstaff, the cleanliness of the restro oms, the appearance of the staff, the \nquenching taste of our beverages, the flavor and freshness of our food, are all \nequal quality points. WE must control for the experience of our guests. Attention to detail is a MUST!  \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  TABLE INTRODUCTION  \nCRITICALLY IMPORTANT!! - Immediately acknowledge all new parties at your \ntables. Regardless of how busy you are; you are never  too busy to let your customers \nknow you see them. They come here to be taken care of, so don't start out their dining \nexperience b y ignoring them. All new customers should be greeted within one minute. \nIf your hands are full, the customer knows automatically that you can't take their order, at \nthat minute. You can pause, smile, and say \"Welcome to Drifter\u2019s , I'll be with you in just \na minute.\" This will satisfy the customer so that they feel important and will be able to \nrelax until you return. \nWhen approaching a table your objective is to make you guests feel welcome and \nconfident in knowing you're there to take care of them. You may develop your style and \nmanner of accomplishing this but here are some suggestions to help you get started: \n \n1. Don't start out by giving your name . Unless your guests already know you, \nthey don't really care what your name is at this point. Focus on THEM. Ma ke \nthem feel welcome; that they've made a good decision to be at our restaurant \nand give them a sense they're in friendly, competent hands. Be observant, not \nscripted. It's o.k. to pay someone at the table a sincere compliment or try to \nopen up some friendly rapport. Later in the meal it's good to give them your name by saying something like, \"By the way, my name is Andrew, just let me know if you think of anything else you'd like.\"  \n2. A\nfter delivering food to the table , give the customer a few minutes to try  the \ndish, and then return to the table. \"Is the burger cooked to your liking? Can I get you another...Scotch and water, ice tea?\" When checking on food items, always accentuate the positive, and eliminate the negative. Do ask, \"Did you \nlike they way your tuna was prepared?\u201d Don't ask, \"Was everything ok \ntonight?\" Ask an intelligent, specific question and show you're concerned about the answer you get. If something isn't right, do what you can make it right. \n3. E\nach time you take an order , be aware of what might elevate the guests' \nexperience. Be relaxed and friendly, polite and professional. Have an idea what extras (appetizers, sides, etc.) you are going to suggest based upon what you genuinely think will enhance your guest's dining experience. Allow the \ncustomers to finish ordering before you jump in with suggestions. If they \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  hesitate, then it's your turn. \"May I suggest the Tuna Tacos? It's one of our \nmost popular dishes.\" If they still hesitate, you might say something like, \n\"Would you like to have a little longer to decide? Take your time and let me \nknow if I can answer any questions.\" \n4. Know everything on the menu in terms of what is in it, and what would go \nwell with it. This will be covered in detail in your initial training and will be \nenforced often in our pre -shift meetings.   \n5. Sug gest premium liquor  in all cocktails. It makes the drink taste better, \nservers are tipped more, and when the guest drinks better, the server drinks \nbetter.  \n6. G et your guests' first drinks  to them within three minutes from taking the \norder; no longer. \n7. S uggest specific appetizers  before you leave the table to get their first drinks. \nIt saves you time and steps. \n8. L earn and use guests' names  when appropriate. Always use \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" \nunless you're told or you're absolutely sure it's proper to use a guest's first name.  \n9. Ma\nke specific suggestions  at every step of the meal if you think it's \nappropriate: drinks, appetizers, sides, wine, desserts, after-dinner drinks. Always keep in mind your first objective is to show your guests a marvelous time, not PUMP UP THE CHECK. Use your best judgment here. Sure we want \nto sell, but more importantly, we want our guests to leave delighted so they \nRETURN!  \n10. L\net your personality shine!  Put your own personal touch into each interaction \nyou have with your tables. Part of why you were hired was because we saw \nsomething shine within your personality \u2013 and we want you to SHOW IT!  \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Ordering Procedures  \nWhen approaching the table, be sure to have your pen ready, book open, and pad ready. \nAsk the customer if they have any questions concerning either the \nspecials or entrees. After answering all the questions, if there are any, \nask if you can take their order. \n \nThrough either eye contact or verbal address, you may start to take their order. Be sure \nto gather all information from each guest before proceeding to the next. If possible, you \nshould take the order from women and children first, and then the men. \nPosition numbers must identify customers; thus, the orders should be written and \nordered in relation to position #1. Position #1 is the seat closest to the first person to your left. Moving in a clockwise direction, continue taking the orders. If no one is sitting \nin position #1, move in a clockwise direction until you find a customer. This customer \nwill become the position #1 customer. The reason is that we need to know who gets what. We use a runner system so there's a good chance someone other than you will be \ndelivering the food to the table. The runner must know where to place the food without \nasking. \nTaking the order is the time for making recommendations. Suggest appetizers that will \ncompliment the guests' meal. This is when wine, craft beer and cocktails can, and \nshould, be offered. \nAlways get the cooking temperature for meats. Our cooking temperatures are as follows: \n1. Rare - Red cool center  \n2. Medium Rare \u2013 Red warm center  \n3. Medium  - Pink warm center  \n4. Medium Well to Well  - Fully cooked with no redness \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Use a small folder, clipboard, or other hard surface to hold your pad while you write up \nthe order. It looks better and makes it easier for you. Begin taking the order at the same \nspot at each table. Start with the person closest to you on your left, and work around \nclockwise. \nExample:  \n \n \n  Again, it is very important that every server records orders in the same way. If a food \nrunner takes the food to the table for you, then he knows where each dish belongs. \nIn case of computers malfunctioning, follow these steps:  \n1. Write appetizers at top of ticket.  \n2. Write entrees under appetizers on the left, and how to cook them on the right \nof check.  \n3. For special orders like rare, be certain to make a notation on the ticket, to call \nspecial attention to the cooks.  \n4. Use the correct abbreviations. Menu abbreviations will be provided with your \nmenu description sheets. \n5. Write all side orders underneath entrees.  \n6. Write desserts underneath side orders. \n7. At very bottom of ticket, put all teas, coffee, milk, and sodas. \n8. Bar beverages will be listed on the back of the guest check only. \n9. After all items have been totaled, circle the total. This way, there will be no mistake of where the total is. Also, write thank you, your name, and have a nice evening, enjoyed having you (etc.). \n \n \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDr\nift\ner\u2019\n \nDrifter\u2019s  Drifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Cooking Times & Handling Timing Problems  \nWith our firing system, once an order is rung to the kitchen, preparation of that item \nbegins. It is imperative that appetizers are rung first. Once an order has been placed, you can expect to receive items within five to eight minutes. This time may lengthen during a \nbusy rush. Your tables' experience is dependent upon your awareness and service to the \ncustomers from the time they are seated; to the time they receive their order. If, by chance, you have a long time ticket, do not hide from your table. Notify a manager immediately, and we will expedite the situation.  \nWhen a table has to wait longer than they should for their food, don't just apologize, get a manager to offer them someth ing for the inconvenience. It costs us thousands of \nmarketing dollars to attract new customers; we can't afford to lose any. A complimentary beverage or dessert is a small price to pay to let a guest know we care about their \nexperience and we want them to come back and give us another chance to get it right. \nIn cases where the kitchen has been woefully out of sync, a dessert or beverage may not \nbe sufficient. Tell the manager -on-duty about the situation. They have the authority to do \nwhatever is needed to try to make amends for a bad-dining experience. \nService Standards & Priorities of a Server  \n\u2022 Greet Guests Immediately  \n\u2022 Hot Food Hot, Cold Food Cold  \n\u2022 Full Hands In, Full Hands Out  \nSuperior Service  \nAfter the initial \u201cHow does everything taste?\u201d Let your presence be known non-\nverbally. If the guest declines dessert and coffee, present the check immediately. \nAt this time let the guest know that if they need anything else, you will be glad to \ndo it.  \n \n\u2022 Meet guest needs without verbal interruptions. For example, if the \nplate/basket is empty, pick it up without comment. The same goes for water and teas that are half empty. This is called \"silent service.\"  \n\u2022 Manicure small items while performing other major functions at the table.  \n\u2022 Remember to be positive while on the floor. Never let the guests see confusion or frustration.  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  \u2022 Don\u2019t be drawn into negative conversations.  \n\u2022 During points of service where you speak to a guest, ask: if you can \nremove items from the table to make their conversation more \ncom fortable.  \n\u2022 Pre-buss your tables!!!!!  \n\u2022 Greeting your table in 30 seconds or less.  \n\u2022 Offer a beverage - suggesting specific choices for appetizers; and \nreturn within 60 seconds with first round, non -alcoholic drinks.  \n \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s   TELEPHONE   \n \nAlways answer the phone saying, \u201cThanks for calling \u201c DRIFTER\u2019S \u201d, this is (give \nyour name) .\u201d Speak slowly and clearly in a polite, businesslike manner. Keep in \nmind that the phone conversation is often the first impression of the restaurant. \nRemain as polite and helpful as possible. For management calls, ask the caller, \n\u201cMay I give him/her your name please?\u201d Be sure the call is forwarded to, and \nanswered by the appropriate person before you hang up. Follow through! When \nputting someone on hold, say \u201cHold please, Sir or Ma\u2019am\u201d. If you know the \nperson\u2019s name, say \u201cCan you hold please, ___________.\u201d  \nTo Go Orders / Phone Etiquette  \nAt Drifter\u2019s , some of our best business is conducted over the telephone. Properly \ntaking and bagging a to -go order is just as important as serving a table.  \n \n\u2022 Every to -go order should be taken with the consideration that the guest \nmay not have a menu in front of them.  \n\u2022 This is your opportunity to up-sell .  \n\u2022 If you answer the phone YOU take the order.  \n\u2022 All to -go orders must be checked and double -checked. A guest \nremembers even the slightest mistake.  \n\u2022 We want to send all of our guests a lingering message that even the smallest detail is important when striving f or perfection.  \n\u2022 The telephone should never ring more than twice.  \n\u2022  It is the responsibility of every staff member to make sure that each \nguest\u2019s call is answered quickly and in a friendly yet professional manner.  \n\u2022 Thank them for calling and be sure that no guest is left on hold for more than a minute.  \n\u2022 If you cannot answer their question or the person that they have asked for is not available, take a detailed message.  \n\u2022 At the end of the call, thank them for calling DRIFTER\u2019S  and invite them to \ncall again.\n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  PERSONAL APPEARANCE  \nYour overall image is our  image. You make a distinct impression on each of our guests. \nThe image you create can enhance or detract from our overall concept \nand the way our Restaurant is perceived in the minds of the guest. You are entr usted with handling our guests' needs and must, therefore, \nreflect cleanliness and wholesomeness at all times. Always remember:  \n \n 1. You are responsible for keeping your uniform neat and clean at all times. There is no \nexcuse for reporting to work out of uniform.   \n2. Do not wear scented lotion on your hands, as it clings to glassware.  \n3. A smile is part of your uniform.  \n4. At no time will emp loyees chew gum or eat while in the public areas of our store.  \n5. Do not report to work with a dirty uniform, or un-kept hair.  \nDining Room Dress Code  \nWhen you walk through the front door of Drifter\u2019s , \"YOU ARE ON.\u201d You will be \ninformed of the uniform requirements when you start with us. Your designated uniform also includes a CONTAGIOUS, ENTHUSIASTIC ATTITUDE. You are required to enter the building for your shift in FULL UNIFORM.

Aprons \u2013 A server\u2019s apron should contain the following at the start of each shift: an \norder pad, 2+ pens, cash bank (recommended $20 total \u2013 two $5 bills, eight $1.00 \nbills and $2 in miscellaneous change.)  \n7. O ther Useful Items  \u2013 include a lighter, wine key and or bottle opener.  \n \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Drifter\u2019s  SUGGESTIVE SELLING  \nSelling is a part of everyone\u2019s life. You had to sell the Drifter\u2019s  management team on \nyour ability to be a capable and competent employee. Our customer is \u201csold\u201d  on Drifter\u2019s  \nbefore they come in. If they enjoy themselves, chances are, they will return and \u201csell\u201d us \nto someone else!  \nPeople don't like to be \"SOLD.\" Effective suggestive selling is subtle. You are doing the \nguest a favor, looking after his best interests by offering your \nknowledge and expertise and making honest recommendations. \n \nMany of our guests are not familiar with our daily specials. As their intermediary, you are \nin the position to smooth the way for a confused guest. Above all, be sincere and honest. \nAlways do what you truly believe is in the \"guest's\" best interest. Recommend items you know are superior and you are certain they will enjoy!  \n* \n* \n* \nNEVER OVER SELL! Always allow the guest to finish \nordering before you start suggesting. Be aware of what the \nguest is ordering and make sure he/she understands what he/she is getting. \nIf a guest orders too much, and you are certain he/she can't \nhandle that much food, advise him/her. He/she will \nappreciate your concern and honesty.  \nSuggest appetizers while people are studying the menu. \"How  about some Tuna Bites; or \nsharing a Grilled Chicken Quesadilla with your dinner this evening?\"  \nSuggest side orders with entrees. \"Would you care for a side salad with your Seafood \nPlatter?\"  \nAlways be persuasive and display complete confidence. Make sugges tions so positively, \nthat the guest wouldn't dream of questioning your recommendation.  \nDon't ask the guest a \"yes or no\" question. This requires him/her to make a decision. \nRemember, people come here to relax, not think. If you display confidence and compl ete \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  product knowledge, the guest will trust your judgment and allow you to take care of \nhim/her.  \nTo sell effectively, you must sometimes bring a need or desire to try something to the surface. Make sure you use the right type of language.  \nFor example:  \no \"Would you like some wine tonight?\" \nIf the guest responds, \"No,\" your suggestion is over before it got started. \no \"Would you care for a bottle of wine with your dinner tonight? A bottle of Pinot \nGrigio would do well to complement your Tuna.\" \nWith this approach, you have exhibited your knowledge and confidence of food and wine \nby suggesting a specific bottle of wine. The guest has now developed confidence in you. \nThis will greatly enhance your opportunity to make this sale and make other recomm endations. \nNot every guest is going to buy a bottle of wine, appetizer, or dessert. But you must \nremember, we know two facts about every customer. \nEvery Customer:  \n1. Is planning to spend money. \n2. Wants to have a good time and enjoy their meal. \nIf you keep these two facts in mind, you will be amazed at how easy it is to sell, \nproviding, of course, you possess the necessary knowledge and confidence. \nThrough suggestive selling you can:  \n1. Increase check totals. The higher the check, the better your chances of a good gratuity. \n2. Expose the customer to a new and different product he/she may not have tried, if you had not recommended it. Thus, the evening is more enjoyable and he/she may return with friends and will now have more reasons to tell others about Drifter\u2019s .  \nRead your guests and suggest appropriate cocktails:  \n1. You can suggest beverages made with your guest's favorite liquor or upsell our premium house wine to guests preferring house wine by the glass. \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  2. If guests seem to be in a hurry, suggest that they eat at the bar, instead of waiting for a \ntable. Busy lunch shifts are a great time to greet guests and invite them to have lunch \nat your bar.  \n3. Do not confuse suggestive selling with overloading your guests with beverages or \nfood. Your goal is a satisfied guest who enjoyed their experience and wants to return.  \n \nSuggestive selling and making personal recommendations is another aspect of good service. Eventually, it will come easily as you build your self -confidence.  \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  SPECIALS & FEATURES OF THE DAY  \nEach day at pre- shift meetings, that day's Specials will be discussed at Drifter\u2019s .  \nWe offer daily specials for three reasons : \n1. To add variety to our menu \n2. To allow our customers the best of seasonal items. \n3. To allow us to test items for future menu development. \n \nThese specials may include a drink special, an appetizer, a salad, a sandwich, a platter, or \na dessert item.  \nIn addition to placing \"specials\" on the boards, you as the server will present the \n\"specials\" verbally. This enables you to describe them thoroughly, and answer any \nquestions the customer may have. \n \nDesserts  \nThe dessert menu, including desserts and dessert drinks, are presented at the table and \nverbally described.  \nIt is a good time to remind guests to save room for dessert, when you return to their table \nto check on the entrees. At this time, you may want to suggest a few dessert items, to plant the thought. Later, when clearing the table, ask your guests if they are ready to try \ndessert. You can then begin to describe a few of your favorite dessert items. \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  CLOSING OUT A TABLE/CUSTOMER  \nPresenting the Check  \nBefore presenting the check, look it over to make sure you have charged for everything \ncorrectly.  \n\uf0d8  Appetizers  \n\uf0d8  Salads  \n\uf0d8  Entrees  \n\uf0d8  Sides  \n\uf0d8  Desserts  \n\uf0d8  Coffee  \n\uf0d8       Wine  \n\uf0d8       Cocktails  \n\uf0d8       SODA \nAfter you have determined that the check is correct, give the check in a booklet to the \nhost of the table (if known), or place it in the center of the table and say \"Thank you.\u201d  \nMake sure to let the customer know, at this time, that you are the cashier and will take care of the check whenever they are ready. There is nothing more aggravating for a customer than wandering around looking for a cashier. People also hate to tip when they are standing up by the front door, waiting for the waiter or waitress  \nAfter presenting the check, take a few steps and glance back at the table. If they already \nhave their cash or credit card ready, it may mean they are in a hurry to leave. If this is the case, try to close the transaction immediately or as soon as possible. Gue sts will notice \nand appreciate this . \nSERVERS - We use a server banking system; you are your own cashier. Your are responsible for all your money, including cash, credit card vouchers, comps, discounts, and voids until the end of your shift. You must start your shift with your own $20 dollars that is used to make your opening change bank. \nBARTENDERS - When you drop the check at the bar, make sure the customer knows \nYOU are the cashier and will take care of the check whenever they are ready. There is nothing more aggravating for a customer than wandering around looking for a cashier. \nIf the customer is paying cash, do not make change right at the table!! Take the check and cash to the back of the house, and make change. Return the check and change on a book, along with the receipt. If the customer is paying with a credit card, follow the house procedure. Once the guest has signed the voucher, pick up both the check and voucher, and again, thank the customer. DO NOT  examine the tip as you leave the customer!!  \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  REMEMBER , the process of closing out the check is the time when the guest is \ndeciding on the tip amount. A bad impression here can undo all previous good \nimpressions, and have a direct effect on your gratuity. \n \nThe Farewell  \nWhen your guests are departing, we have four distinct objectives: \n1. To make sure their experience in our restaurant was pleasurable.  \n2. Thank them, by name, for their patronage. \n3. To invite them back for another visit soon. \n4. To make sure their last impression is a positive one. \n Methods of Payment  \nApproved methods of payment are Cash, VISA, Master Card, Discover and American Express. WE DO NOT ACCEPT CHECKS!  \nIn the event that the guest has no other option for payment, we will accept a check, but \nyou must also take down his/her driver\u2019s license number, current address, and phone \nnumber. \nHandling Cash \nHere are the procedures to follow when receiving a payment in cash - \n1. As noted above, never make change at the table - go to the nearest server \nstation.  \n2. When making change, always count it twice.  \n3. Give the guest some ones and five dollar bills to tip you with. \n4. Return the change to the guest's table in a book. \n5. Always keep your cash and receipts in your apron. \n6. Paper bills make no noise when it hits the floor so be very careful with your \nbills.  \n7. Never leave your money or wallet unattended. \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  8. If you are concerned about carrying too much cash during a shift, make a \ndrop with a manager in exchange for an IOU. \n9. Always remember, treat credit card vouchers and voids like they are cash - THEY ARE. Handle with care!  \nCredit Cards / Decline Procedure  \nIf at any time a guest\u2019s credit card is declined, th e server must handle the matter \ndelicately and discretely. The image/ego of the guest must be maintained. DO \nNOT approach the table and in front of the guest and his guests, announce that there is a problem with his credit card. A more reasonable approach would be to announce \u201cSir/Madam there is a phone call for you\u201d. When the guest is away from the table, discretely/tactfully tell the guest of the problem. **\nWe do not \naccept checks**  \n \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  CHECK-OUT PROCEDURES  \n1. Your computerized register system will print out your guest check at \nthe end of each table's meal. This alleviates the issuance of any \nmanual guest checks. \n2. Once a guest check is printed out and a customer has paid, you will close out that check to cash, Master Card, VISA, Discover or \nAmerican Express, or other forms of payment. You must keep all \nprinted out closed guest checks for checkout. \n3. Before beginning your checkout each shift, check the following: \n\u2751 Make sure all your customers are through, have been tabbed, and \ndo not need anything else. I.e. dessert, tea, etc. \n\u2751 Be certain the manager has closed your section for the shift. \n\u2751 Make sure you have collected from all of your tables and have all your tickets with you. \n\u2751 Make sure your tables are wiped down and clean. \n\u2751 Be certain that all of your side work and closing duties are done. \n\u2751 Make sure that you have your full uniform on at all times, while in the front of the house. \n\u2751 Have a manger do any deletions of voids, over rings, and promo tickets. All over rings must be signed by a manager at the time they occur, and not at the end of the shift. You never sit down to eat, drink, or smoke until all of the above are completed. Starting your checkout before all your customers are finished is grounds for termination.  \n\u2751 When bringing in your receipts to the office to do your final close-out, make sure that all of your receipts are in order from lowest Order # to the highest.  \nOver Rings & Voids  \nAny time you make a register mistake of an item you did not want to ring up. Get a \nmanager immediately to correct this on the register, and notify the kitchen or bar NOT \nTO PREPARE THAT ITEM. Over rings and voids are register mistakes of items never \nserved or prepared.  Anytime a void is done, a ticket must be printed, the reason entered \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  on the ticket and the ticket initialed by a manager.  All void tickets must go with the \ncredit card slips and cash turned in at the end of each shift.  Any voids without tickets \nwill not be considered voids.  YOU will be responsible for payment. \n \nHouse Promo  \nOccurs anytime an item has been prepared and served to a customer that was not satisfied with the item. Perhaps it was under or over cooked, or the glass was chipped, etc. This would include a customer waiting too long for their meal. Only a manager can do this function on the register. Get the manager before closing any house promo tickets. \n  \nManager Promo \nOccurs anytime a manager wishes to buy a table a round of drinks, perhaps a dessert, or \nany free purchase approved by a manager promoting good will to our patrons. Inform the manager when you are serving a regular guest you would like to buy a drink for, a special \nguest to send an appetizer out to, a large party, or to send complimentary desserts. Please \nintroduce the manager to these customers by name. We want to help you develop a large regular following. From time to time, the restaurant will have contests promoting such clientele builders. Get the manager on duty before closing out any manager promo \ntickets.  \n \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Employee Discount/Customer Discount  \nOccurs anytime the full amount of an item will not be collected. For example, employee \nmeals or coupons offering $2.00 off any menu item, or buy one, get one free coupons, or frequent lunch program discounts. Only a manager can discount guest checks on the \nregister. Get the manager on duty before closing out any discount checks. \nComps  \nA comp occurs anytime an item has been prepared and served to a customer that was not \nsatisfied with the item. Perhaps it was under or over cooked, etc. This would include a customer waiting too long for their meal. Only a manager can do this function on the register. Get the manager before closing any comp tickets.   \nNow You Are Ready To Check Out!!  \n1. Prepare the Server Checkout. Make sure you have no open checks. \n2. Be certain charge totals of Master Card, Discover, VISA, and American Express, along with promos, discounts or other charges balance with what you have on your guest checks. Use the calculator to double check. If they do not balance, this \nmeans that you are missing a guest check, or charge receipt \n3. The following items should be ready for the manager, before you enter the office: \no Voids, comps, and over rings accounted for on register.  \no Have all money counted and faced. \no Have all charge vouchers matched with the ticket they paid for.  \no All receipts in order by order number.  \n4.  There should only be ONE person in the office doing checkout at a time. This \nhelps eliminate unnecessary confusion and mistakes. Please use the calculator \nprovided for you. \nIf for some reason you cannot balance to the register totals, ask the manager for \nassistance.  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Tip Reporting \nAs an employee of a Drifter\u2019s , all the tips you receive - whether in cash or included \nin a credit card transaction - is taxable income to you. You are required, by \nfederal law, to report and record your actual tips for each shift .  \n \n\u25cf At the end of each shift, tipped employees must disclose on the Server \nCheck -Out, the amount of credit card tips and total tips less any tips \nshared with any other employees. Your tips will be recorded and reflected in total on your paycheck stub. Endorsement of your paycheck indicates that you acknowledge that your tip information on the stub is accurate and correct.  \n\u25cf It is the employee\u2019s respon sibility to comply with IRS requirements of \nreporting all your tip income. While you are responsible for reporting all of your tip income, the Restaurant may be required to allocate additional tip income to any tipped employee that does not declare at leas t 8% of their \ngross sales as tip income.  \n\u25cf We strongly encourage you to accurately report your tip income. This will reduce the chances of you being audited by the IRS and allows you to qualify for greater social security, unemployment and worker\u2019s compensat ion benefits.  \n \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  ALCOHOL AWARENESS  \nAlcohol Awareness is a growing concern within the Hospitality Industry nationwide. By \nrecognizing the \"early\" signs of intoxication, monitoring your \ncustomer's consumption, and treating them as you would a guest in your own home; you fulfill your responsibility and protect the guest. \nWith adherence to the company's policies...  \n1. We will not knowingly admit obviously intoxicated or underage \ncustomers to the bar. \n2. We will not knowingly serve alcohol to an obviously intoxicated or underage customer. \n3. We will offer alternative to underage customers.  \n4. Intoxicated customers cannot remain on the premises once service is refused.  \n5. We will create an atmosphere to promote responsible drinking, documenting everything. \n6. We will make a reasonable attempt to prevent obviously \nintoxicated customers from driving. \n. . . We can accurately and confidently answer that very important question. \n\u2022 Responsible service of alcohol requires a team effort.  \n\u2022 Know and watch for the signs of intoxication. If there is any question, avoid further service and report to a manager who will make the final decision and determine whether the guest should remain or leave.  \n\u2022 If you know what it takes to get someone drunk, you can prevent it by monitoring their consumption and offering alternatives. \n\u2022 Do not allow drunks to come in, and do not allow intoxicated guests to drive. \n\u2022 Hospitality is our business. Beverage service is only one element. \n\u2022 Cooperation between employees and management allows us to exercise a degree of inf luence on the behavior of our customers that will result in an \natmosphere of responsible drinking. \n\u2022 This is just a portion of our company Alcohol Awareness program. A complete RSVP class will be taught by our Virginia ABC Special Agent. \n\nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  Drifter\u2019s  Alcohol Awareness Standards  \nServing alcohol is a privilege that is granted by local authorities. This privilege \ncarries with it a duty for us to operate in a responsible manner and involves public \nsafety and considerable liability to the company as well as our employees. It is our \npolicy to deal with situations that arise from serving alcohol. If there is any \ndoubt as to the age of a guest. Ask them for proof of age. Be polite, but remember; you, as well as the restaurant, can be held liable if a minor is  served. \nRemember, these policies are designed for our guests\u2019 safety. They must be applied impartially. Alcohol awareness is a serious subject; and you, the Server or \nBartender, are the most important element of the Program.  \nTake Action  \nIf you feel that a  guest is intoxicated, you should cease serving the guest drinks \nimmediately and inform your Manager. If the guest persists in ordering alcoholic \nbeverages, acknowledge the drink request, but ask the Manager to explain to \nyour guest that the drink must be declined.  \nAlcohol Policies  \nOur policies are designed to discourage over- consumption of alcohol. \nThey are:  \n1. -Perception of our bar as quality, not quantity.  \n2. -Not allowing drinks to \u201cstack up\u201d in front of a guest.  \n3. -Suggesting food to accompany drinks  at the bar.  \n \nWatch For These Signs  \nBe aware of the condition of your guests at all times. Any guest who has consumed more than two drinks could soon be approaching intoxication.  \nAn intoxicated person will usually display recognizable behavioral characteristics. Alert Manager at the first s ign of any of these:  \n\u2022 Slurred speech, thick -tongued  \n\u2022 Eyes become glassy, unable to focus  \n\u2022 Unusual change in the color of facial skin, going pale or flushed  \n\u2022 Loss of physical motor skills; staggers or stumbles when walking, \nspills drinks or food \n\u2022 Abusive languag e; questioning the Server\u2019s performance; profanity, \nbragging  \n\u2022 Obvious changes in behavior; more or less talkative; loud voice  \n\u2022 Exaggerated emotional outbursts; crying or loud laughing  \n\u2022 Unable to respond coherently when addressed or questioned  \n\u2022 Unreasonable and exaggerated responses  \n\u2022 Blank, staring facial expression  \n\u2022 Obvious impairment of judgment  \n\u2022 Annoying other guests  \nBe Prepared  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  You will be dealing with a person who is to some degree \u201cout of control\u201d. The \npsychological message we give the guest is that we are in  control of this \nsituation. The guest will probably be offended and become argumentative. Do not attempt to \u201creason\u201d with the guest. If you know the guest is belligerent or \nphysically threatening, approach the guest with another employee (preferably a \nMana ger). If the guest continues to be a problem, inform the Manager. Never \nattempt to physically detain a guest on the premises.  \n\u25cf We will not serve alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person.  \n\u25cf We will not knowingly serve a person alcoholic beverages that is under the legal drinking age. It is our policy to card anyone who \nappears to be under 30 years old.  \n\u25cf If a guest is \"cut off\", they must leave the premises immediately!  \nNOTE: A person with a physical or mental disability may seem to have the same \noutward appearance as a guest who has had too much to drink. Your sensitivity is extremely important in all situations. We will not knowingly allow anyone on our staff that is under the legal drinking age to serve or dispense alcoholic beverages  \n \nChecking Identification  \nBy law, you are responsible for carding anyone that you suspect is not of legal drinking \nage. Do not put yourself in jeopardy by serving a minor. \no Check ID's of anyone who appears to be under the age of 25. Also, card guests \nappearing to be under 25, who return an empty glass and order another drink. \no Try to serve only guests you can see. Minors may send someone older for their \ndrinks. \nDoubles  \nOur pricing on doubles is as follows: for a double drink, charge twice the normal price. There are two reasons for this policy: \n\uf0a7 We do not want to encourage our guests to become intoxicated. \n\uf0a7 In mixed and blended drinks, adding an extra shot of liquor alters the flavor. We believe that the standard recipes are the best way to serve these drinks.  \nIf a guest requests a double mixed drink, explain the price and advise him that we do not \nrecommend serving the drink that way. If they persist, accommodate them, and then notify a Manager. \n  \nDrifter\u2019s  \nDrifter\u2019s  SANITATION  \nThe responsibility of management and staff to protect the public from food borne illness \nis fundamental. A food borne illness is simply a disease that is carried, \nor transmitted, to human beings by food. Throughout your training, you will receive information concerning proper temperatures of food \nstorage and serving, as well as, cleanliness standards, proper use of \nchemical cleaning, and disinfectant products. It is our objective to operate the restaurant at the highest level of cleanliness and sanitation \nfor the benefit of our customers and employees. \n \nSAFETY PROCEDURES  \nIn addition to a clean and sanitary environment, Drifter\u2019s  provides a safe environment. \nOne of our goals here at Drifter\u2019s  is to operate an accident -free \nrestaurant. A safe restaurant takes teamwork and effort on everyone's \npart. Everyon e who works with cleaning chemicals will receive training \non the use of those products, and will be tested following the guidelines \nof OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal \nregulations 1910.1200. \nSafety meetings will also be used to review information presented from the initial training, and a safety representative will be selected for the Employee Associate Board of \nDirectors. Management's role is to provide the daily monitoring of safe work practice \ndeveloped from these meetings. \nWhenever you see a potential hazard, or something you notice as unsafe, notify a \nmanager immediately.  \nHere is a list of guidelines to follow for safety and sanitation: \nMajor cause of food borne illness - \n\u2022 Food left in the danger zone of 40\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 for four or more hours.

Appearance and hygiene have \na direct impact on the overall experience we provide. Remember, our \nguests\u2019 experiences are based on the use of their senses. What they see, \nhear, smell, touch, and taste in our restaurants affect how they \nremember their experiences, whether they will retur n, and whether \nthey recommend us to others. To maintain the necessary high \nstandards and to present our guests with an appropriate image, we have \nestablished guidelines governing the attire, cleanliness, and appearance \nof our crew members.  \nCrew Members  \n\uf0a7 Shoes, Socks:  Comfortable closed -toe, rubber -soled, safe shoes are \nrequired. Shoes must be clean and polished. Socks are required.  \n\nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  4 3/18/2020  \uf0a7 Hair:  Hair must be neat, clean, and styled in a conventional \nmanner.

If a name tag is lost, the company may charge the \nemployee for the replacement , to the extent allowed by Fair Labor \nStandards Act  \nUniform Standards  \nCrew members wear different uniforms in each of our restaurants, with \nthe restaurant providing part of the uniform. Remember, appearance \ncreates an important first impression for our guests and our team \natmosphere. Crew members are responsible for their uniform care. All \narticles should be clean, pressed, and available to wear prior to each \nshift. A ll aspects of the uniform are subject to management approval.  \nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  5 3/18/2020   Orientation Period  \nYou have been through our employee selection process, have been \nselected for employment, and appear to have the potential to develop \ninto a successful employee. However, we want the opportunity to \nbegin the training period, get to know you, see how you fit in with \nyour co -workers, and determine if you are willing and able to carry out \nthe responsibilities for the position in which you were hired. It\u2019s also \nimportant for you t o get to know us and become familiar with how we \noperate to find out if this job is for you. We have a 30 -day orientation \nperiod for that purpose referred to above. The 30 -day period allows \nboth you and the restaurant to see whether or not it\u2019s a good fit and if \nnot, part the restaurant amicably. During the orientation period you \nwill begin your training and be observed by management. Also, during \nthis time if you feel you do not understand what\u2019s expected of you or \nthat you need additional training, we enc ourage you to ask questions \nand seek additional help from our management staff.  \nSchedules  \nSchedules are prepared to meet the work demands of the restaurant. As \nthe work demands change, management reserves the right to adjust \nworking hours and shifts. Schedules are posted weekly. Each \nemployee is responsible for working his or her shift.  \nEmploy ees should arrive 10 to 15 minutes before the shift begins so \nthat they have time to get settled and ready for the shift. Employees are \nto clock in when the shift begins and be ready to start work \nimmediately.  \nSchedule changes may be allowed only if the e mployee finds a \nreplacement and receives management approval. To be valid, the \nmanager must indicate and initial the change on the posted schedule. \nThe restaurant usually requires high levels of staff on or around \nholidays, sporting events, and other speci al events. Understanding that \nemployees have a life outside of the restaurant, we always try to find a \nway to work with our employees to meet schedule requests. We do, \nhowever, ask employees to remember just how crucial each position is \nto the proper funct ioning of the restaurant. Ensure that your employees \nunderstand that even though we will try to comply with requests, there \nis no assurance that you will be able to grant the requested time off in \nall circumstances.  \n\nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  6 3/18/2020  Tardiness and Absenteeism  \nEmployees must  be prepared to start work promptly at the beginning \nof the shift.

Realizing that emergency situations can arise \nand people do become ill, ask that employees provide you with the \nmost amount of time possible to allow you to attempt to cover the \nshift. Calling in minutes before a scheduled shift puts both the guests \nand other employees at a disadvantage. Under n o circumstances should \nan employee call and leave a message on the answering machine. \nEmployees must speak to the manager in charge directly.  \nAll employees are expected to work on a regular, consistent basis and \ncomplete their regularly scheduled hours per  week. Excessive \nabsenteeism should result in disciplinary action, up to and including \ntermination. Disciplinary action taken because of absenteeism should \nbe considered on an individual basis, following a review of the \nemployee\u2019s absentee and overall work  record.  \nAny employee who does not call or report to work for two consecutive \nshifts should be considered to have voluntarily resigned.  \nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  7 3/18/2020  Payment Procedures  \nTime Clock/Time Cards  \nEmployees should arrive at the restaurant 10 to 15 minutes before they \nare sc heduled to start work.

Consistent portioning is \nimportant to customer satisfaction. Your customers may order the \nsame dish many times; it\u2019s important that each time it comes out of the \nkitchen it looks and tastes the same.  \nAlong with the actual garnish ingredients, think abou t how you want \nthe food to be arranged on the plate  or in the container . Factors to \nconsider when arranging include:  \n\uf0a7 Layout  \n\uf0a7 Balance  \n\uf0a7 Serviceability  \nDo not over -stack, or over -portion, a plate  or container .  \nRecipes  \nIt is critical that all instructions a nd measurements on recipes be \nfollowed exactly. Always use the recipe sheet when preparing any \nproducts. These steps must be followed so that we serve food with the \nsame great taste, texture, and color to every guest, consistently, each \ntime.  \nWhen preparin g recipes, you need to know the units of measure used \nfor ingredient portions.  \n\uf0a7 Weight units are pounds and ounces and are measured using a \nscale.  \n\uf0a7 Volume units are cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, etc. and are \nmeasured using cups and spoons.  \n\uf0a7 Quantity (each)  is the number of items as in the number of bags, \ncans, boxes, patties, etc. that are in the recipe.  \nEach recipe will have a procedure. T hese are the actual steps you will \nfollow in order to prepare the recipe.  All steps must be completed and \nthey must be d one in the order that they are listed.  \nYou also need to consider the shelf life of the food items prepared.  \nThis is how long the product may be held before it no longer meets our \nhigh standards for quality.  \n\nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  44 3/18/2020  Food Storage and Rotation  \nAll food products use d in the restaurant are dated when they are \nreceived and put into storage and dated again when they are prepared. \nProducts are always rotated using the FIFO method.  \nFIFO Rotating System  \nAlways refer to the \u2015received on\u2016 or \u2015prepared on\u2016 date and use the \noldest products first as long as the \u2015use by\u2016 date has not passed. If the \n\u2015use by\u2016 date has been passed, notify the manager, discard the product, \nand mark it down on the waste report form.  \nFood Dating Labels  \nDating labels are stickers used to assist employe es with properly \nrotating food. Every product that is prepared receives a food label.  \nWhat to Write on the Label:  \n\uf0a7 Product name or abbreviation  \n\uf0a7 Date  \n\uf0a7 AM/PM  \n\uf0a7 Initials  \nStorage  \nWhen deliveries are received, products need to be unloaded and placed \nin storage in  the following order:  \n\uf0a7 Walk -in cooler  \n\uf0a7 Freezer  \n\uf0a7 Stockroom (dry storage)  \nChilled products need to go directly to the walk -in cooler first as they \nare the most perishable items.  \nPlace new product on the bottom or in back of older product so that the \nolder produ ct is most accessible and is used first. Always use a food \nlabel or a permanent black marking pen to record the date received.  \n\nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  45 3/18/2020  Storing Products in the Walk -in Cooler  \n\uf0a7 Organizing the walk -in cooler is crucial. Place frequently used \nitems near the door so t hey are easily accessible.  \n\uf0a7 Always place raw products below cooked or ready -to-eat products.  \n\uf0a7 Fish and shellfish products are highly perishable. Store these items \naway from the door in the coldest areas of the walk -in. \n\uf0a7 Eggs and dairy products can absorb odor s and flavors from other \nfoods. These products should be stored in tightly sealed containers \nand away from foods with strong odors like fish, certain cheeses, \ncabbage, and onions.  \nStoring Products in the Freezer  \n\uf0a7 The temperature in the freezer should be mai ntained at 0\u00ba to \u201310\u00baF.  \n\uf0a7 All items in the freezer should be at least six inches off the floor \nand the containers must stay sealed or the product will become \nfreezer -burned.  \n\uf0a7 Once an item has thawed, even partially, it should NOT BE \nREFROZEN. Only remove pr oducts from the freezer that will be \nused promptly.  \nStoring Products in Dry Storage  \n\uf0a7 Keep the stockroom organized and clean of debris at all times.  \n\uf0a7 Keep all food products at least six inches off the floor.  \n\uf0a7 Keep all chemicals on a bottom shelf separate from all other \nproducts.  \n\uf0a7 Place heavier containers on the lower shelves.  \nLine Cook Training Manual  \n[Restaurant Name]  46 3/18/2020  Controlling Waste and Storage  \nIn order for our restaurant to be successful, we not only have to serve \ngreat food and deliver outstanding service , but we also have to control \nour costs.  \nFood cost is the total of all money spent by the restaurant on food \ningredients in a given period, expressed as a percentage of total sales \nover the same period.

Keep all \nfoods out of the danger zone of 40-140 degrees. \n\uf0a7 Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. \n\uf0a7 Handle foods quickly during delivery, and put refrigerated and frozen foods \naway as soon as possible. \n\uf0a7 Sloppy personal hygiene habits will not be tolerated. \n\uf0a7 Do not prepare food a day or more before serving. \n\uf0a7 Do not serve food that is not completely cooked. \n\uf0a7 Thaw foods in refrigerator, microwave,  or under cold running water for not \nmore than 2 hours, followed immediately by cooking. \nAlways wash your hands after you- \n\uf0a7 Smoke, eat, use the restroom; touch money, raw foods, or your face, hair or \nskin; cough, sneeze, or blow your nose. \n\uf0a7 Comb your hair, handle anything dirty. \n\uf0a7 After taking a break. \n \nAvoid preparing food in advance, unless absolutely necessary. \n \nInspect foods thoroughly for freshness and wholesomeness upon receipt and serving. \n \nOnly use sanitized equipment and table surfaces. \n \n 3 \nWet floors, even a few drops of water, can cause a serious accident.  Make sure you use \ncaution when entering the kitchen.  Also, wipe up any spill at once, when floors are wet slow \ndown. \n \nSweep up, DON\u2019T pick up glass.  Always remove and place in outdoor trash immediately.   \n \nReport every accident, no matter how small, to manager on duty. \n \nDispose of waste properly- \n\uf0a7 Take garbage out frequently. \n\uf0a7 Keep garbage areas clean. \n\uf0a7 Clean and sanitize garbage cans regularly. \n\uf0a7 Store soiled linen in a laundry bag or non- absorbing container.  Make sure you put \nthem in the PROPER container. \nHandle ice properly- \n\uf0a7 Use clean scoops to pick up ice.  Do not use hands or glass and DO NOT DIP \nBUCKET!!!!! \n\uf0a7 Store scoops in a clean container, not in the ice. \n\uf0a7 Do not store any food or beverage in the ice. \n \nAvoid cross contamination from one food item to another-use DELI LIST \n\uf0a7 Never mix leftovers with fresh food.  \n \nALCOHOL AWARENESS \n \nAlcohol awareness is a growing concern within the hospitality industry nationwide.  By \nrecognizing the \u201cearly signs of intoxication,\u201d you can monitor your customer\u2019s consumption.  \nBy treating them as you would a guest in your home, you fulfill your responsibility and \nprotect the guest.  Before beginning your first shift as a server you must complete \nIPACT Training,  this is a web based service offered by the State of Iowa to insure you \nknow and understand all of the rules in regard s to serving alcohol in the State of Iowa.  \nYou may take the online class at home or if you don\u2019t have the internet, ask the manager to \nset up a time to use the stores.  This is available at http://iowaabd.com/education/resources/ipact  \n To serve or not to serve? \n By understanding and fulfilling your responsibilities\u2026 \n YOUR ROLE  \n1. OBSERVE \n2. MONITOR \n3. REPORT \n 4  \nAssisted by the guidance and support of management\u2026 \n YOUR MANAGER\u2019S ROLE \n1. CONFIRM \n2. CONFRONT \n3. RESOLVE \n \nWith the adherence to the company\u2019s policies\u2026 \n1. We will not knowingly admit or serve obviously intoxicated or underage \ncustomers anywhere on the premises. \n2. We will offer alternatives to alcohol. \n3. We will create an atmosphere to promote responsible drinking. \n4. We will make a reasonable attempt to prevent obviously intoxicated customers \nfrom driving. \n \n\uf0b7 Responsible service of alcohol is a team effort. \n\uf0b7 Know and watch for the signs of intoxication.  If there is any question, avoid \nfurther service and report to a manager wh o will make the final decision and decide \nwhether the guest should remain or leave. \n\uf0b7 Do not allow drunks to come in, and do not allow intoxicated guest to drive.  Get a \nmanager involved. \n\uf0b7 Hospitality is our business.  Beverage service is just one element. \n\uf0b7 Cooperation between employees and management allows us to exercise a degree of \ninfluence on the behavior of our customers that will result in an atmosphere of \nresponsible drinking. \n \nLIQUOR LAWS \n \nRemember at all times that we have a responsibi lity in taking care of our guests, to whom \nwe are serving alcoholic beverages. \n \nIt is against the law to: \n\uf0a7 Serve alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. \n\uf0a7 Serve alcoholic beverages to an underage pe rson.  If you are in doubt, it is your \nresponsibility, as a server of alcoholic be verages, to ask the individual for proper \nidentification. \n\uf0a7 Permit any intoxicated person to remain on the premises.  Do not try to handle this \ntype of situation yourself: GET A MANAGER. \n\uf0a7 Allow anyone to bring alcohol in any form into the restaurant with them. \n\uf0a7 Serve liquor from any bottle not purchased by the restaurant. \n 5 \uf0a7 Allow anyone under legal drinking age to sit at the bar.  They are allowed to sit in \nthe bar area, but not at the bar.  \n\uf0a7 If they have an out of state ID, ask the manager on duty. \n \nCHECKING IDENTIFICATION \n \nBy law, you are responsible for carding anyone th at you suspect is not of legal drinking age.  \nIf they look younger than 35 years old-ID!!!!  If  you even have a little doubt ID!!!!  Do not \nput yourself in jeopardy by serving a minor.  Th e Sports Page Grill policy is that we do not \nserve alcohol to anyone with a vertical in-state  license.  Check ID\u2019s of anyone who appears \nto be under the age of 35, also, who returns an empty drink and wants to order another \ndrink. \nServe only guests you can see.  Minors may try to send someone older for their drinks. \n \nTHE GUEST \n1. Never underestimate the im portance of a guest!! \n2. A guest is not dependent on us\u2014we are dependent upon them. \n3. A guest is NEVER an interruption of our work - he/she is the purpose of it. \n4. A guest does us a favor when he/she comes here \u2013 we are not doing him/her \na favor by serving him/her. \n5. A guest is part of our business \u2013 not an outsider. \n6. A guest is deserving of the most courteous and attentive treatment we can \ngive him/her. \n7. A guest is the lifeblood of The Sports Page. \n \nOur function as a RESTAURANT is to acquire  and maintain business, to turn casual \ncustomers into loyal, repeat guests. \n \nFive basics of service excellence: \n1. Look at me. \n2. Smile at me. \n3. Talk to me. \n4. Listen to me. \n5. Thank me. \n \nRemember, every restaurant owes its existence to its customers.  When a customer forms \nan opinion of any food establishment, service and food presentation stand alone.  No \nmatter how beautiful the surroundings or ho w delicious the food; poor service will \ncertainly ruin the entire dining experience. \n \n 6 When developing good service, promote these qualities: promptness, courtesy, good \nmanners, enthusiasm, and teamwork .  In short, project a professional attitude.  Unless you \nattain this goal, you will not be able to provide the high quality of service we expect here \nat The Sports Page. \n \nYou will be trained by our most experienced,  qualified people.  The more attentive, \nenthusiastic, and patient you are, the sooner you will develop the work habits which make \nyou an excellent server, capable of taking great care of our guests and be rewarded \nfinancially too.  \n \nServicing the public, in any business, requires a vast amount of humility and patience.  \nAlways maintain a friendly, but professional attitude.  If you need help, ASK FOR IT.   \nEven if you become an excellent server, there will be times when you will get behind.  Have \nenough consideration for your customers, and the house, to get assistance WHEN \nNECESSARY.  Remember, teamwork, no business ca n survive without it.  We have provided \nyou with this service manual.  In it we have outlined some helpful suggestions to make your \njob here more profitable and enjoyable.  These are the tools of your trade.  Use them \nwisely and they will help you prosper. \n \nArrive on time for your shift properly dres sed, with scrubbed hands and nails, pressed \nshirt, and clean shoes.  If your appearance is sloppy, your performance will be sloppy.  Your \nappearance, dress, posture, and expressions broadcast to everyone how you feel about \nYOU.  Take pride in yourself, and others will be proud of you. \nIntroduce yourself.  Customers want to know who is serving them; it is the added personal \ntouch they enjoy.  Also, if they have enjoyed their visit, they can request your station \nagain.  They might even tell their friends to ask for you.  Call parties are the best tippers.  \nIn this manner, you can develop a following. \n \nWhen people go out to eat, they want to relax.  They want you to help them decide what to \neat, when to order, what to drink, etc.  You are there to fulfill their needs.  Don\u2019t be \npushy, do be confident.  Often times a customer is nervous.  It is your job to make guests \nfeel comfortable, so comfortable they want to come back. \n \nDon\u2019t be afraid of customers.  90% of the people dining out won\u2019t notice a small mistake.  \nBe relaxed, but alert, and efficient.  Always be in control of a situation.  Be strong, yet \npolite. \n \nAlways be yourself.  Develop your own tables ide manner.  Avoid using repetitious phrases \nor seeming \u201cplastic.\u201d  Your customers will know you are faking it, and they will resent your \nattitude. \n \nCustomer service turn offs: \n 7 1. Dirty plates in hand when greeting customers, \u201cHi, ready for dessert?\u201d \n2. Not knowing what they are drinking, i.e. \u201cI think this is the Diet Coke\u2026\u201d \n3. \u201cDiscussion Groups\u201d of three or four idle servers.   \n4. Not acknowledging waiting guests. \n5. Answering the phone with \u201cHold please.\u201d \n6. Greeting guests with a number, i.e., \u201cTwo?\u201d instead of a smile and \u201cWelcome!  Will \nanyone be joining you for lunch today?\u201d \n \nSERVER PRIORITIES \n \nSuccessful sales and service result from conf idence, which can only be developed through \nknowledge.  We will provide you will ample material to develop the necessary knowledge and \nconfidence in relation to service techniques and the menu.  You, as a server for The Sports \nPage, must learn it. \n1. When taking an order, always look the customer directly in the eyes, and stand \nerect.  Never lean or write on the table.  \n2. Never handle a glass by the rim with your hand over the drinking surface. \n3. Never handle silverware with your hand over the eating surface. \n4. When handling plates or fo od never let your hand touch the eating surface or \nthe food. \n5. Know what time to be here for each shift.  Do not call and ask! \n6. Know what the daily specials are and what they cost. \n7. Know the history of the restaurant.  www.thesportspagegrill.com   \n8. Know the managers. \n9. Avoid any long conversations at any partic ular table. This will only upset your \nother customers. \n10. Clear your mind of everything except work when you walk in the door.  When \nyou\u2019re at the table make sure your mind is at the table too.  Guests can tell when \ntheir server is not totally mentally present with them at the table and it has a \nnegative impact on the guests\u2019 experience and the server\u2019s tip. \n11. If you get behind, ask for assistance.  You\u2019ll never get in trouble for asking. \n12. Keep yourself geared up so that you are ready for any rush.  We get most of our \ncomplaints during the restaurant\u2019s slow periods. \n13. Don\u2019t ever stand around or lean on anythi ng.  You can always be cleaning: Running \nclean up, wiping shelves or the sales station, taking bus tubs to the back, etc.  \n14. Always be sure that all your food is secure when you leave the window.  Never \nattempt to carry too much.  Two safe trips are better than one catastrophe. \n15. Always enter the kitchen carefully.  Always walk quickly, but never run.  This will \nprevent serious accidents and extra work for everyone. \n 8 16. If an order is delayed in the kitchen, first inform the manager, and then tell \nyour customers.  The manager will go to the table and explain the situation as \nwell.  Get your stories straight.  Never hide from the customers. \n17. Learn to use your time wisely.  When in your station, check all the tables before \ngoing back to the waitress station.  Don\u2019t go to one table, and then go back to \nthe waitress station.  Consolidate your trips.  Fill up all glasses in your whole \nstation, clear all plates, and then go on to something else.  This is the secret to \nrunning volume and making more money.  Always try to take out complete orders.  \nIf the entire order is ready except for a side order, like a vegetable, take out \nthe entrees and have someone follow you in a few seconds with the side order.  \nDon\u2019t\u2019 let the entrees get cold because of a side order.  Everything goes out hot. \n18. If your entire section fills at one time, don\u2019t take orders from four or five new \nhits at once.  You\u2019ll end up running your self to death for twenty minutes, and \nthen have nothing to do for ten.  Take one order, then go to the next table and \ntell them you will be right back to take their order.  Take drinks and appetizers \nout to the first table, and then go to the others.  Never take three or four \nsalads out at one time.  This only means that you will have three or four orders \nof hot food coming out at the same time, which would be impossible to get out \nall at once.  Think ahead.  You won\u2019t believe how patient people will be if they \njust see you.  Don\u2019t hide from your customers .  If you use this method in taking \norders, you will find that your food will be out more consistently on time, and \nyou will give much better service overall.  You will have more time to converse \nwith your customers.  People look for more than just good service and food when \nthey go out today.  They want a total dining experience.  They look for that \nlittle extra personal touch which only you as their server can give them.  Never \nspend more than two minutes away from your station.  No server ever made \nany money in the kitchen . \n19. Anytime you wait on a customer put yourself in their place and ask yourself if \nyou would be happy with the job you did at that table. \n20. If one person asks for something at a table, make sure you ask everyone at the \ntable if they too would like that item (such as water).  This will save you a lot of \nextra trips.  If one person requests more tea, ask everyone at the table if they \nneed more tea or more to drink. \n21. When pouring tea or water, never handle the rim of the glass and always take \nthe glass off the table and pour in the aisle.  \n22. Whenever you are reaching across someone or serving in front of someone \nexcuse yourself. \n23. Always keep you fingers and thumb off the plates you serve. \n24. Punctuality is very important.  If you get to work late, you start out behind.  BE \nON TIME!! \n25. We know that servers work for tips.  All people do not realize this.  If you get \nslighted on a tip, it may be because people think the tip is included in the bill or \n 9 because they just don\u2019t like to tip. The customer is not required to tip.  If you \nget stiffed, it is unfortunate, but you must take the good with the bad.  An \nemployee discussing a bad tip will not be tolerated and is grounds for \nimmediate dismissal .    Do not discuss it or complain about it! \n26. NEVER SIT DOWN WITH A CUSTOMER or friend while on duty, even if they \nask you to. \n27. When waiting on parties of one, special attention should be paid to them.  They \nare generally in and out quicker than other parties, and they are usually the best \npercentage tippers. \n28. If a customer leaves you an offer to buy you a drink, just tell them you will be \nhappy to accept the offer another time, when you are not on duty. \n29. The most neglected customer in the restaurant is the late customer.  People who \ncome in the last few minutes of the evening are usually the best tippers.  They \ndon\u2019t care how busy it was or how tired you are.  They are here to enjoy \nthemselves.  Restaurants are noted for hurrying along late coming customers.  \nWe are not rushing them, but we must get their order because the kitchen is \nclosing.   They may sit there and enjoy their meal as long as they wish.  Treat \nthem as though they are the first customers of the evening. \n30. A tip should never be removed from a table while the customer is still \nthere .  Unless, however, the customer hand s it to you or motions for you to \ncome and get it. \n31. If you are having a problem with another employee, go directly to the manager.  \nDo not harass the employee. \n32. If you must go to the bathroom during the shift, ask someone if they will please \nwatch your station while you are gone, and inform a manager so that they are \nnot looking for you. \n33. Unauthorized persons are not allowed in th e kitchen.  If one appears, politely \nbut firmly escort them out and get the manager, or whoever it was they wanted \nto speak to. \n34. No server is to change his or her stat ion or pick up extra tables without the \nconsent of the manager on duty. \n35. Tips are not included: except for part ies of 8 or more, and only with the \nmanager\u2019s consent (18%). \n36. Never serve salad on hot plates. \n37. No eating or drinking in front of the house during operating hours.   \n38. Never attempt to adjust the lights or thermostats in the restaurant.  If there \nis a problem, get a manager. \n39. Serve women and children first, then men. \n40. Whenever serving a course, position the plate so that the \u201cmeat\u201d of the course \nis closest to the customer. \n41. Remove soiled china and silver after each course.  Make sure to ask them if they \nare finished.  \n 1042. Top off with offer of additional beverages whenever anyone is getting low. \n43. Bring condiments to the table before they are needed. (i.e. app plates and \nsauces) \n44. Respect your BOH staff-they make it your job easier!   \n45. Dine-n-Dash if you think it could happen with a table get a manager; we are not \nresponsible, you are. \n46. Never walk away from a table without acknowledging its requests. \n47. Never assume that the change is your tip!  Tell the customer that you will \nbe right back with their change.  This gives them the opportunity to say, \n\u201cKeep it!\u201d  Make change right at the table, especially with large bills . \n48. If you want to return to the restaurant after work and have a cocktail, maintain \na very high standard of behavior, leave at last call, and be the very first to leave \nwhen the lights go up. You may not come into the back of the house after you \nhave been drinking.  \n \n \nMISCELLANEOUS THINGS TO REMEMBER: \n \n \n\uf0a7 NEVER ask the bartender to make something without a ticket.  Always ring in the \norder and send it. \n. \n\uf0a7 Make sure you are ringing in all beverages  \n\uf0a7 Do not overfill ramekins with butter, sour cream, honey butter, etc. \n\uf0a7 Make sure all sides and extras are rung in. \n\uf0a7 Don\u2019t take any food without a ticket.   \n\uf0a7 If you have two items that are the same, but are cooked differently, the stick will \nnormally be the less cooked. \n\uf0a7 If you have several items that are the same and only one is cooked different, the \nodd one will have the stick.  Ask to be sure. \n\uf0a7 Do not sit while you are working.  If you have time to sit, you have time to clean.  \nAlways do the clean list. \n\uf0a7 Keep waitress station clean.  If you open something, put it away.   \n\uf0a7 Don\u2019t eat while you are working.  You need to come in early, or eat when your shift \nis over.   \n\uf0a7 Before you open something, make sure it\u2019s not already open. \n\uf0a7 If you make a mess, clean it up. \n\uf0a7 Check you tables over and over and over . \n\uf0a7 Hair needs to be pulled away from face. \n\uf0a7 Don\u2019t be late. Arrive at least 5 min befo re schedules shift in uniform ready to \nwork. \n 11\uf0a7  Our schedules will be posted 3 weeks at  a time.  Specific days off must be \nrequested in writing by Friday for the next schedule due.  The managers will work \nwith you regarding schedules; however our primary concern is the proper staffing \nof the restaurant.  We will try to satisfy scheduling desires; however, our business \nrequires you to have the flexibility to work varied schedules. The number of hours \nyou work in a given week is li kely to vary.  It is your re sponsibility to your schedule. \n\uf0a7 You are REQUIRED to attend all scheduled meetings \n\uf0a7 If you are unable to report to work for any reason, you must notify your \nsupervisor at least 3 hours in advance, and make arrangements to have \nsomeone else cover your shift.  Your replacement is YOUR responsibility.  IF \nYOU CANNOT FIND ANYONE TO COVER YOUR SHIFT YOU MUST REPORT \nTO WORK!!!!!!!!!! \n\uf0a7 If you are going to be late for work, your supervisor must be no tified as soon as \npossible.  Remember Sports Page and your fellow employees depend on you! \n\uf0a7 We work on a tip out system here.  It  is REQUIRED that you tip out your \nbartender 10% of your tips every night!  That means even if they do not make one \nsingle drink for your tables that night, yo u still will tip out!!!  In the long run this \nwill even out.  Also, it will help you appreciate how much they are doing for you when \nthey have their own customers too. \n \nQUALITY CONTROL \n \nQuality control is a primary responsibility of every employee serving food and drinks to \nthe customer.  You are the last person to come in contact with the food before the \ncustomer does.  If something does not look right or is not presentable, DO NOT SERVE \nIT!  The saying \u201cPeople eat with their eyes\u201d is very true.  Make sure all of your products \nlook good on the plates. \n \nThings to look for as the food are leaving the kitchen. \n \n1. HOT food.  Few things are more basic but important.  Check to see if your food is \nhot.  Just because something is in the window, does not mean that it is hot.  If it is \nnot hot, DO NOT TAKE IT OUT.  Tel l the manager.  This will alleviate a lot of \nproblems. \n2. Clean plates.  Always check any plates, mugs, silverware and napkins before you \npresent them to the customer.   Check food plates for grease spots, spilled food, etc. \n3. Correct portions.  Always check to see that the product is in the right portions.   \n4. Make sure you are taking your order.  This  can be very embarrassing at the table.   \n5. Appearance:  Always ask yourself if you wo uld eat that item if it were brought to \nyou. \n 126. Call for back-ups.  If something in the kitchen looks low and you are about to run \nout, TELL SOMEONE.  If you take one of th e last bowls of soup, call for back-ups.  \nIf the salad is warm or wilted, do everyone a favor, and say something before the \ncustomer is served. \n7. When bringing out drinks be certain the glass is clean, filled to the proper level, \nand that the garnish is correct, fresh and attractive. \n8. Cold food is as equally important as hot food.  Make sure cold foods are going out \ncold, not warm or cool, but cold. \n9. Bring necessary condiments with order: i.e., ketchup, mustard, Parmesan cheese, \netc. \n10. Check back\u2026within two bites to make sure everything is perfect.  Don\u2019t say, \u201cIs \neverything o.k.?\u201d  Say something like, \u201cHow\u2019s your ribeye cooked?\u201d  Be specific and \nsincere in wanting to know the answer. \n11. Remember, the appearance of the exterior of the building, the greeting of the \nhost, the cleanliness of the restrooms, th e appearance of the staff, the quenching \ntaste of our beverages, the flavor and freshness of our food, are all equal quality \npoints WE must control for the experience of our guests. \n \nCOUPONS/DISCOUNTS/EMPLOYEE MEALS: \n \nWhen you first greet a table, it\u2019s a good idea to ask if they have any coupons.  This can curb any misunderstanding of our coupons late r.  Make sure you know and understand the \ncoupon.  Ask the manager if you are unsure about a coupon or discount.   \n\uf0a7 The manager must okay any and all discounts and/or coupons.   \n\uf0a7 Only one discount or coupon is valid per table.   For example, a customer can\u2019t get \nthe kids eat free meal  and a free appetizer  on the same ticket if they don\u2019t have \nthe amount of meals needed. \n\uf0a7 Save all discount tickets .  That includes the actual meal  ticket and discount ticket.   \nWhen you have a discount, it\u2019s a good idea  to automatically print 2 receipts.  That \nway if the customer takes their receipt, you already have a copy of it, and you don\u2019t \nhave to worry about it.   \n\uf0a7 On employee discount tickets, make sure you write the employees name on the \ndiscount ticket.  If it\u2019s your own, write your own name on it. \n\uf0a7 Managers take care of all voids.  Keep th e ticket along with the cancellation ticket, \nand write a brief explanation. \n \nAs an employee of The Sports Page, you receive a discount of 50% on certain items. \nEmployees DO NOT  receive an employee discount on:  \n\uf0b7 Entrees \n\uf0b7 Pastas \n\uf0b7 Kids meals \n 13\uf0b7 Desserts \n\uf0b7 Pitchers \n\uf0b7 Liquor \n*The employee discount is only for the employee, not friends and family.** \n \n  \nPAYROLL \n \nPaychecks are issued every other week and may be picked up after 2PM at the bar.  Ask \nthe bartender or the manager on duty to get it for you.  Pay period starts on Monday and \nends on the following Sunday (2 weeks).  Please do not call and ask if they are done early.  \nYour paycheck will be issued to only you,  unless we have both written and verbal \nauthorization.  Garnishments-Under the Federal/State Garnishment Laws, it is possible \nfor someone to whom you owe money to have money withheld from your check.   WE DO \nOFFER DIRECT DEPOSIT AND SUGGUEST THIS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE \nYOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 3 DAYS EARLIER .   \n \nATTITUDE \n \nWhen working in the service industry, you must have a positive attitude with your \ncustomers, as well as wi th your coworkers.   \n \no Read the order back to the customer. \no Make sure customer gets their salads  and bread before their food order \ncomes up.   \no Watch for quick items, such as specials and sandwiches.  Hold the ticket \nuntil salads and apps are ou t and close to finished.   \no Double check the order when putting in the computer.   \n \nChecking on the customer: \n\uf0a7 When you bring the food out, ask the customer, \u201cIs there anything else I can get \nfor you right now?\u201d \n\uf0a7 How is everything? \n\uf0a7 How is your steak cooked?   \n\uf0a7 Always keep drinks full.  Give refi lls before their be verage is gone. \n \n \n \n 14 \nCOMPLAINTS \n \nThere is no standard for dealing with unhappy customers, because each customer is \ndifferent.  When a customer has a complaint, always listen carefully to what the \nproblem is.  Some problems can be taken care of relatively easily, if you just listen to \nthe customer.  Other complaints need to be taken care of by the manager.   \n \n\uf0a7 If someone doesn\u2019t like their food, or they are just unhappy with their meal, \nimmediately take the food aw ay from them and apologize.  Ask the customer if \nyou can get them something else.  Listen carefully to what the problem is.  Try \nto get as much information from the cust omer as you can, before you go to the \nmanager.   \n\uf0a7 Let your manager know that there is a problem.   \n\uf0a7 If something is undercooked, offer to put it back on the grill and get it cooked \nthe way they want it. \n\uf0a7 If you put the order in wrong, let the manager know so they can get the correct \norder in and out as quick as possible.   \n\uf0a7 Don\u2019t \u201cpass the buck.\u201d  For example, don\u2019t tell the customer that the kitchen \nscrewed up, etc.  Be polite, apologize and take care of any complaints as quick as \npossible.    \n \nTABLE INTRODUCTION \n \nCRITICALLY IMPORTANT!! \u2013 Immediately acknowledge all new parties in your section.  \nRegardless of how busy you are, you are never too busy to let your customers know you see \nthem.  They come here to be taken care of, so don\u2019t start out their dining experience by \nignoring them.  All new customers should be greeted within one minute. \n \nIf your hands are full, the customer knows automatically that you can\u2019t take their order, \nat that minute.  You can pause, smile, and say \u201cH i, I\u2019ll be with you in just a minute.\u201d  This \nwill satisfy the customer so that they feel im portant and will be able to relax until you \nreturn. \n \nWhen approaching a table your objective is to make your guests feel welcome and \nconfident in knowing you\u2019re there to take care of them.   \n \nYou may develop your style and manner of accomplishing this, but here are some suggestions to help you get started: \n 151. Be observant, not scripted.  It\u2019s o.k. to pay someone at the table a sincere \ncompliment or try to open up some friendly rapport.  Later in the meal it\u2019s good to \ngive them you name by saying something like, \u201cBy the way, my name is Andrew, just \nlet me know if you think of anything else you\u2019d like.\u201d \n2. Each time you take an order, be aw are of what might elevate the guests\u2019 \nexperience.  Be relaxed and friendly, polite  and professional.  Have an idea what \nextras (appetizers, sides, etc.) you are going to suggest based upon what you \ngenuinely think will enhance your guest\u2019s dining experience.  Allow the customers to \nfinish ordering before you jump in with suggestions.  If they hesitate, then it\u2019s your \nturn.  \u201cMay I suggest the Cajun shrimp pasta or chicken?  It\u2019s one of our most \npopular dishes.\u201d  If they still hesitate, yo u might say something like, \u201cWould you like \nto have a little longer to decide.  Take your time and let me know if I can answer \nany questions.\u201d \n3. Know everything on the menu in terms of what is in it, and what would go well with \nit.  This will be covered in detail in your initial training. \n4. Suggest premium liquor in all cocktails.  It makes the drink taste better and \nservers are tipped more. \n5. Get your guests\u2019 first drinks to them within five minutes from taking the order; no \nlonger. \n6. Suggest specific appetizers before you leave the table to get their first drinks.  It \nsaves you time and steps. \n7. Learn and use guests\u2019 names when appropri ate.  Always use \u201cMr.\u201d or \u201cMs.\u201d unless \nyou\u2019re told or you\u2019re absolutely sure it\u2019s proper to use a guest\u2019s first name. \n8. Make specific suggestions at every step of the meal if you think it\u2019s appropriate: \ndrinks, appetizers, sides, wine, desserts, af ter-dinner drinks.  Always keep in mind \nyour first objective is to show your guests a marvelous time, not PUMP UP THE \nCHECK.  Use your best judgment here.  Sure  we want to sell, but more importantly, \nwe want our guests to leave delighted so they RETURN!! \n \nORDERING PROCEDURES \n \nWhen approaching the table, be sure to have  your pen ready, book open, and pad ready. \n \nThrough either eye contact or verbal address, you may start to take their order.  Be sure \nto gather all information from each guest before proceeding to the next.  If possible, you \nshould take the order from women and children first, and then the men. \n \nTaking the order is the time for making recommendations.  Suggest appetizers that will \ncompliment the guests\u2019 meal.   \n \nAlways get the cooking temperatures for meats.  Our cooking temperatures are as follows: \n 16 Rare \u2013 Bloody cool center, touch of rawness \n Medium rare \u2013 Bloody red, no rawness of meat \n Medium \u2013 Pink warm center \n Medium Well to Well \u2013 Fully cooked with no redness \n \nUse a small folder to hold your pad while you write up the order.  It looks better and \nmakes it easier for you. \n \nSUGGESTIVE SELLING \n \nPeople don\u2019t like to be \u201cSOLD.\u201d  Effective suggestive selling is subtle.  You are doing the guest a favor, looking after his/her best in terest by offering your knowledgeable and \nexpertise and making honest recommendations.  \n \nSuggest appetizers while people are studying the menu.  \u201cHow about some Buffalo Wings \nor sharing some beef nachos, with your dinner this evening?\u201d \n \nAlways be persuasive and display complete conf idence.  Make suggestions so positively that \nthe guest wouldn\u2019t dream of questioning your recommendation. \n \nThrough suggestive selling you can: \n1. Increase check totals.  The higher the check, the better your chances of a good \ntip. \n2. Expose the customer to a new and different product he/she may not have tried, if \nyou had not recommended it.  Thus, the evening is more enjoyable and he/she may \nreturn with friends and have more reason to tell others about The Sports Page. \n \nSuggestive selling and making personal recommenda tions is another aspect of good service.  \nEventually, it will come easy as you build your self-confidence. \n \nRINGING GUEST CHECKS \n \nWe use a food runner system.  There will be times when someone else delivers food to your customers.  It is crucial that you ring in the correct table numbers.  \n \nCooking Times & Handling Timing Problems: \n\uf0b7 Once an order is rung to the kitchen, preparation of that item begins.   \n\uf0b7 Appetizers must be rung in first and sent to the kitchen before the main meal.   \n 17\uf0b7 Once an order has been placed, you can expect to receive lunch items within 6-12 \nminutes  and dinner items within 8-15 minutes .  This time may lengthen during a \nbusy rush.   \n\uf0b7 Your tables\u2019 experience is dependent upon your awareness and service to the \ncustomers from the time they are seated to the time they receive their order.   \n\uf0b7 If, by chance, you have a long time ticket, do not hide from your table.  Notify a \nmanager immediately, and we will expedite the situation.  When a table has to wait \nlonger than they should for their food, don\u2019t just apologize, ask a manager to offer \nthem something for the inconvenience.  Communication can make the difference \nof an upset or happy table!  \n \nUNIFORM \n \nWhen you walk through the front door of the restaurant, \u201cYOU ARE ON.\u201d  Your \ndesignated uniform includes an ENTHUSIASTIC ATTITUDE.  \n \nYour uniform also includes the following, without exception: \n\uf0a7 Clean Iowa Hawkeyes, Iowa State Cyclones, UNI Panthers, or Sports Page \nShirt, unless otherwise told different from a manager .   \n\uf0a7 Shorts or pants of appropriate length and with no holes or cuts \n\uf0a7 Shoes\u2014no open toes or heels \n\uf0a7 At least two pens \n\uf0a7 Apron \n\uf0a7 Smile \n\uf0a7 Appropriate change for your shift, we suggest $25 in fives, $25 in ones, and \n$8 in random nickels, dimes and quarter s.  If change is needed throughout \nshift management or bartenders will help but they will not at the beginning of \nyour shift . \n \nPERSONAL APPEARANCE \n \nYour overall image is our image.  You make a distinct impression on each of our guests.  The \nimage you create can enhance or detract from our overall concept and the way our \nrestaurant is perceived in the minds of the guest.  You are entrusted with handling our \nguests\u2019 needs and must, therefore, reflect cleanliness and wholesomeness at all times.  \nAlways remember\u2026 \n\uf0a7 You are responsible for keeping your uniform neat and clean at all times.  \nThere is no excuse from reporting to work out of uniform. \n\uf0a7 Your hair will be fashionably styled and clean. \n\uf0a7 The only jewelry that will be allowed is that  which is complimentary to your uniform. \n 18\uf0a7 Hands must be cleaned and manicured while at work. \n\uf0a7 Do not wear scented lotion on your hands, as it clings to glassware. \n\uf0a7 A smile is part of your uniform. \n\uf0a7 Do not report to work with an un-pressed or dirty uniform, or unkempt hair. \n \n \n \nCLOSING OUT A TABLE \n \nPresenting the Check \nBefore presenting the check, look it over to make sure you have charged for everything \ncorrectly. \n1. Appetizers \n2. Soups \n3. Salads \n4. Entrees \n5. Sides \n6. Desserts \n7. Coffee/Pop \n8. Alcohol \n \nAfter you have determined the check is correct, give the check to the host of the table \n(if known), or place it in the center of the table and say \u201cThank you.\u201d  Make sure to let the \ncustomer know, at this time, that you are the cashier and will take care of the check \nwhenever they are ready.  There is nothing more aggravating for a customer than \nwandering around looking for a cashier.  People also hate to tip when they are standing up \nby the front door, waiting for the server. \n \nAfter presenting the check, take a few step s and glance back at the table.  If they \nalready have their cash or credit card ready, it may mean they are in a hurry to leave.  If \nthis is the case, try to close the transaction immediately or as soon as possible.  Guests \nwill notice and appreciate this. \n \nIf the customer is paying cash, make change right at the table!!  If the customer is paying \nwith credit card, follow the house procedure.  Once the guest has signed the voucher, \npickup both the check and voucher, and again, thank the customer.  DO NOT examine the \ntips as you leave the dining room!! \n \nREMEMBER, the process of closing out the check is the time when the guest is deciding on \nthe tip amount.  A bad impression here can un do all previous good impression, and have a \ndirect effect on your tip.  \n 19 \n \n \nTHE FAREWELL \n \nWhen your guests are departing, we have four distinct objectives: \n1. To make sure their experience in  our restaurant was pleasurable. \n2. Thank them, by name, for their patronage. \n3. To invite them back for another visit soon. \n4. To make sure their last impr ession is a positive one. \n \nOPENING, RUNNING, CLOSING DUTIES \n \nEvery shift at the restaurant has opening, ru nning, and closing duties.  These duties are \nposted on the board.  These duties are extremely important in assuring smooth daily \noperations and ongoing quality service.  These duties require teamwork, and through \nteamwork, we will maintain excellence in service. \n \nOpening and closing duties will not be consider ed complete until approved by the manager \non duty.  Running duties refer to ongoing duties  while the restaurant is open for business.  \nThe responsibility of making sure these duties are being done during the shift is that of \nyou and your teammates.  Some duties will require individual effort, while others will \nrequire team effort. \n \nCHECK-OUT PROCEDURES \n \nBefore beginning your checkout each shift, check the following: \n1. Make sure all your customers re throug h, have been tabbed, and do not need \nanything else, i.e., coffee, tea, etc. \n2. Be certain the manager has closed your section for the shift. \n3. Make sure you have collected from all of yo ur tables and have all your tickets with \nyou. \n4. Make sure all plates, silverware, glassware,  and containers are cleared from all of \nyour tables. \n5. Be certain that all of your side work and closing duties are done. \n6. You never sit down to eat, drink, or smoke until the entire above is completed.  \n  \n \n 20 \n \n \n \nNOW YOU ARE READY TO CHECK OUT!! \n \n1. Arrange all your money in order and faced. \n2. Credit cards slip must match total on reading. \n3. Discounts all stapled with appr opriate copies and coupons. \n4. Drop total must equal NET Deposit \n5.

Check pop in back \n5. BE IN CHARGE!  COMMUNICATE WITH FO H AND BOH!  Only you can pull food \nout of the window unless you ask for help.  Make sure is goes out CORRECTLY. \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n 21 \n \n  There is a lot of information contained in the manual.  However, there is even more \nthat is not. \n We have given you the basics, as we view them, and how we would like them to be \nconducted.  There is no section in this manual concerning \u201cteamwork.\u201d  The reason \nfor this is that we feel this topic falls  under the \u201ccommon sense\u201d category.  We \nwant you to use the service tips in the manual, along with your common sense, and above all, YOUR INDIVIDUALITY, to he lp create an atmosphere that will \nencourage good times for our customers, and yourself.  When this happens, you will \nbe ensuring the success of not only The Sports Page, but also yourself. \n \nGood luck and thank you for your dedication!! \n \nI have read and understand the server training \nmanual that was given to me. \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nEmployee Signature     Date \n  \n________________________ ______________________ \n    M a n a g e r  S i g n a t u r e       D a t e",
