echo "   ✅ No layout shifts when loading starts"
echo "   ✅ Loading indicator stays in fixed input area"
echo "   ✅ Thinking state shows spinner instead of dots"
echo "   ✅ Streaming state shows animated dots"
echo "   ✅ Chat area remains stable during loading"

echo ""
echo "4. Loading States in Input Area:"
echo "   • Thinking: Spinner + 'Assistant is thinking...'"
echo "   • Streaming: Dots + 'Assistant is responding...'"
echo "   • Retrying: Dots + 'Retrying connection (1/3)...'"
echo "   • Offline: No indicator, shows offline message"

echo "5. User Experience Benefits:"
echo "   ✅ Stable layout - no jumping or shifting"
echo "   ✅ Clear feedback in consistent location"
echo "   ✅ Professional appearance without distractions"
echo "   ✅ Input area provides all loading context"
echo "   ✅ Chat history stays clean and readable"

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. User sends message"
echo "2. Input area shows spinner + 'Assistant is thinking...'"
echo "3. First chunk arrives, changes to dots + 'Assistant is responding...'"
echo "4. Streaming completes, loading indicator disappears"
echo "5. Input ready for next message"
echo ""
echo "• NO layout shifts in chat area"
echo "• NO temporary messages appearing/disappearing"
echo "• ALL feedback contained in input area"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:"
echo "=================="
echo "• Send message: Watch input area only for loading feedback"
echo "• Fast response: Brief spinner, then streaming dots"
echo "• Slow response: Spinner persists until first chunk"
echo "• Network issues: Retrying feedback in input area"
echo "• Stop during thinking: Loading clears immediately"

echo ""
echo "📱 Visual Improvements:"
echo "======================"
echo "✅ No chat area layout shifts"
echo "✅ Stable message positioning"
echo "✅ Consistent input area height"
echo "✅ Professional loading feedback"
echo "✅ Clean conversation view"

echo "Try asking: 'How do I fix my fryer?'"
echo "Watch the input area for loading feedback - chat should stay stable!"
