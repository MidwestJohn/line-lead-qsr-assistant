There must never be a dark build up on \nthe grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nEvery week use the flat to p thermometer to calibrate the temperature of the flat tops. This \nprocess will ensure the flat top is cooking even throughout the grill.  \n \nTurn the grill on at 9:00 AM to get ready to begin the day\u2019s cooking process.  \n \n \nGrill Calibration:  Thermostat Adjustment Procedure  \n \nEach week the grill surface temperature is to be checked to insure that the grill temperatures are \ncorrect.  Initially the temperature was adjusted at the factory. However, if the grill surface \ntemperature varies greatly from the sett ing on the thermostat knob adjust the thermostat using the \nfollowing procedure:  \n \n1. Turn all the control knobs to the 350\u00b0F setting.  \n2. Wait 30 minutes (or 1 hour if grill was cold) for surface to stabilize.  \n3. Place a thermocouple with surface temperature probe ha lfway back from the front to the \nback of the grill plate and directly over a burner set (in line with a burner control knob).  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  7 \n \nCheck the temperature over each burner set every 5 minutes until the temperature over \neach burner set stabilizes and does not chan ge by more than 30\u00b0F between two \nconsecutive measurements.  \n4. If the average temperature over any burner set is not within 30\u00b0F of the knob setting \n(350\u00b0F), adjust the corresponding thermostat by removing the knob, holding the \nthermostat stem (do not allow st em to turn or temperature setting will be changed) and \nturning the small screw located within the base of the stem. Turn this screw counter \nclockwise to increase the temperature, clockwise to decrease the temperature.  \n \n \nGrill Cooler  \n \nIt is the responsibili ty of the cook to maintain the proper ingredient inventory in the grill \ndrawers. The grill cook must constantly be aware of the temperature of products in the grill \ndrawers. Refrigerated products require a temperature of 40 degrees F or less to assure a \ntemperature that does not promote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nMaintain a minimum of a two hour inventory of product in the grill cooler to include:  \n\uf0b7 4.7 ounce hamburger portions  \n\uf0b7 Chicken breasts  \n\uf0b7 6 to 1 and 8 to 1 Hot dogs  \n\uf0b7 Turkey patties  \n\uf0b7 Veggie patties  \n\uf0b7 American, cheddar, Swiss, Bleu, and shredded cheddar cheese  \n\uf0b7 Saut\u00e9ed onions  \n \nTwice a day check the temperature of product in the grill drawers to insure products are \nmaintained between 34 and 40 degrees.  Temperature checks are  made at 10 am and 4 pm.  \nRefrigerated products require a temperature of 40\u00b0 F or less to assure a temperature that does not \npromote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nBreak Down of the Grill Cooler  \n \n\uf0b7 At closing each night, the ent ire grill cooler and bun flat tops area must be thoroughly \ncleaned and sanitized. Use the current grill cleaning method to ensure the best result.  \n\uf0b7 Pull out all products and wrap with plastic wrap.  Make sure to date each item.  \n\uf0b7 Manager must be notified of a ny item which appears to be of inferior quality or is out of \nshelf life.  Items can only be discarded with manager\u2019s permission.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  8 \n \n \nMeat Grill Setup  \n \nIt will take 15 minutes for the grill to warm up to the correct temperature. Season the grill with \noil from the fryer before cooking.  The temperature of the burger and bun grills is set to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Burger grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n\uf0b7 Bun grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n \nSmall equ ipment required:  \n\uf0b7 One meat spatula  \n\uf0b7 One poultry spatula  \n\uf0b7 Grill scraper  \n\uf0b7 Grill squeegee/scraper  \n\uf0b7 One spatula for veggie burger/grilled cheese  \n\uf0b7 Red, yellow and black tongs  \n\uf0b7 Digital thermometer  \n\uf0b7 Six dome lids  \n \nOther items required:  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with water  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with liquid margarine  \n\uf0b7 Burger seasoning in stainless shaker  \n\uf0b7 Small bucket with a clean towel and sanitizer solution  \n\uf0b7 Roller and with liquid margarine for buns  \n \nDuring the shift the grill is cleaned and maintained to minimize build -up of carbon on the \nsurface. There must never be a dark build up on the grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nGrease tub :   The grease tub is designed to contain grease run off from the grill surface. The \ngrease tub must never be allowed to overfill.  Empty the grease tub tw ice daily and dispose of the \ngrease properly.  \n \n \nBurger Cooking Procedure  \n \nProper cooking and seasoning of burgers is paramount to making a great burger.  Always place \nthe burger at the beginning of the grill that is designated for the first stage of the co oking \nprocess.  Placement of the burgers is important in maximizing the space on the grill and tracking \nthe cooking process.  All burgers are cooked to medium well.  On request burgers can be cooked \nto well done only.  Burgers cannot be cooked less than me dium well.  \n.   \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  9 \n \n1. Using the meat tongs, place the burger meat on the grill three burgers\u2019 distance (14 \ninches) from the side of the grill.  The side of the grill is determined by the product flow \nto the expo station.  \n2. Press burger using steak weight into a 5 in ch patty.  \n3. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  Move burger using spatula.  \n4. Cook for 2 minutes 30 seconds and flip the burger.  \n5. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  \n6. Check burger doneness in 2 minutes 30 seconds.  To check that the hamburgers are \ncooked throughout, place a small nick in the center of the burger. If the juice comes out \nclear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be cooked a little more.  The internal temperature \nmust reach at least 160\u00b0 to 165\u00b0 F.  \n7. Dredge burg er through accumulated burger fat on the grill.  \n8. Put cheese on burgers immediately if requested and cover with dome.  Pull burgers \nwithout cheese off the grill.  \n9. Allow cheese to partially melt (10 to 15 seconds) and remove burger from grill.  \nAmerican cheese  takes 10 seconds and the other cheeses take 15 seconds.  \n \nCritical Success Factors  \n \n\uf0b7 Use the burger seasoning mix on both sides of the burger.  \n\uf0b7 Do not over season product (use correct seasoning distribution container).  \n\uf0b7 Do not allow the cheese to over melt.  \n\uf0b7 To check that the hamburgers are cooked throughout, place a small nick in the center \nof the burger. If the juice comes out clear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be \ncooked a little more. The temperature must be 160 to 165 degrees.  \n\uf0b7 It is important to properly forecast the flow of burgers to be placed on the grill based \nupon:  \n1. The flow of Guest coming through the door.   \n2. The number of take -out tickets.  \n3. The number of Guest tickets spooling out of the printer.  \n \n \nVeggie Burgers  \n \nProcess:  \n\uf0b7 Squirt water on  the grill where you will be putting the veggie burger.  \n\uf0b7 Using tongs, place the veggie burger on the grill that is assigned for the veggie \nburger.

One, the flavor is sealed in at the medium -well done stage \ngiving the burger a crisp outer edge. Secondly we must always be conscious of the s afety \nof our Guests. All possible bacteria are cooked out at  155\u00ba. We will never put our Guest \nat risk by cooking a burger any other way.  \n \n\uf0b7 Another key to cooking a great Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s burger is to add the quarter \nteaspoon of seasoning on the burger  at just the right time.

Word of mouth is our life blood to success. We want our \nTeam Members and Guest to know we have the highest of standards in regards to the 3 \nS\u2019s  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  42 \n \nSanitation  \n \nThe primary goal of a food service sanitation program is to protect the Guest from food -\nborne illness. This task is not easy, but it can be done. The most effective method is a \nthree -staged attack:  \n \n1. Protect food against contamination between the temperatures 41\u00b0 -140\u00b0, the danger \nzone.  \n2. Reduce the effect of contamination that does occur.  \n3. Ensure all Team Members are well versed in sanitation procedures.  \n \nThe definition of sanitized is the reduction of h armful bacteria to a safe level.  \n \nTwo common causes of food borne illness:  \n1. Cross Contamination.                                    \n2. Food remaining in the danger zone too long.  \n \nTwo ways to avoid cross -contamination:  \n1. Ensure proper hand washing with soap and hot water for 20 seconds and rinse.  \n2. Use proper color coded cutting boards and use proper utensils.  \n \nFood contamination may occur from any of three hazards:  \n \n1. Biological  - Bacterial contamination. This is controlled by practicing safe food \nhandling and stora ge procedures.  \n2. Chemical  - Contamination of foods with pesticides, use of excessive additives, and \ncontamination of food with toxic metals. Proper storage of chemicals and equipment \nand use of proper storage containers control this.  \n3. Physical  - Contamination  of foods with broken glass, metal fragments, etc. This can \nbe controlled by good facilities maintenance, planning, and training Team Members \nin safe operating procedures.  \n \nFood Poisoning  \n \nThe fear of food poisoning is always present in every restaurant.  Years of effort in \nbuilding a great food service reputation can be destroyed, virtually overnight, if an \noutbreak occurs in an establishment.  Food poisoning occurs in two ways:  \n \n1. A food -borne infection (disease which occurs from eating food which contains  a \nharmful micro -organism)  \n2. A food -borne intoxication (when poisons or toxins in the food cause illness in the \nbody.)  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  43 \n \nFood Handling  \n \nIt is of the utmost importance that food is handled with the greatest care to prevent the \nspread of any bacteria that may cause food poisoning.  \n \nBacterial reaction creates what is called a TOXIN.  Toxins that are produced by bacteria \nare poisonous in the finished cooked product.  Sometimes, although we think that we \nhave taken adequate care of our products; bacterial acti ons in these products are such that \nthe toxins produced will remain poisonous.  \n \nWatchwords in the food service industry are KEEP IT HOT, OR KEEP IT COLD, or \nDON\u2019T USE IT.  All products must remain heated or refrigerated to maintain a product \ntemperature wi thin the food safeness range: Do not hold at room temperature!  \n \nRefrigerate to: 40\u00b0 F or below  \nHeat to: 140\u00b0 F or above  \n \nPotential Food Safeness Problem Areas in a Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s:  \nThe manager must inform Team Members to notify him/her if any of the f ollowing \nprocedures have occurred:  \n \n1. Containers of prepared foods not labeled with date and time.  \n2. Canned products that are swollen.  \n3. Any bone chips in the burgers.  \n4. Chicken that is not rotated and has a foul odor.  \n5. A foul odor when a can is opened or if the p roduct appears to be unusually thinned.  \nDO NOT TASTE THE PRODUCT. It is probably unsafe. Contaminated food could \ncause you to become extremely ill.  \n6. Have sanitizer buckets at all appropriate stations. Buckets must be changed every half \nhour or as needed.  \n7. Product left in opened can and put back in the cooler. No canned product must ever \nbe stored in the original container once it has been opened.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  44 \n \nWalk -In Cooler  \n \nFungus, mold, or spoilage may occur on the outside surface of some items in the walk -in \ncooler.  In the walk -in cooler, warm air rises and condensation falls.  All bacterial growth \nrequires warmth and moisture.  When the door of the cooler is opened warm a ir from the \noutside rushes into the cooler.  This causes condensation on the food products stored on \nthe lower shelves or floor.  The moisture contacting the meat or produce can cause a \nslimy surface. Temperature of the cooler and cold units must be 40\u00b0 or  less.  \n \n1. Items stored on lower shelves of the walk -in cooler must be products that cannot be \ncontaminated through condensation.   \n2. The middle shelves have the greatest air circulation.  \n3. The top shelves must be used to store perishable items such as lettuce,  tomatoes, and \nother perishables that require a colder temperature.  \n4. Follow food hierarchy with all products in cooler.  \n \nNo matter how well the refrigeration unit is cleaned and sanitized, if fungus or mold \nspores contaminate the refrigeration unit, they ca n reproduce and contaminate the entire \ncooler area.  Although the cooler may be clean one day, if the fan, drip pan, and \nrefrigeration unit are not cleaned as well, the entire cooler area can be re -contaminated.  \nTherefore, when the walk -in units are clean ed, also clean the pans, the fan blades, the \nunits themselves, and the top of the refrigeration units . \n \nGrill Table Sanitation  \n \n1. All products must be stored in proper containers to prevent meat juices from dripping \ninto the other product.  \n2. The drawers must remain closed when not in use.  \n3. The internal temperature of the product in the grill table cooler inserts must be \nchecked periodically during the day using a probe thermometer to ensure all \ningredients are refrigerated to 40\u00ba F or below.   \n4. Product should nev er be left in the grill coolers overnight. All products should be \nremoved and taken to the walk -in cooler for storage.  \n5. To avoid cross contamination the cook must never handle raw meat and then touch \nthe cheese going on top of the burger.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  45 \n \nStorage  \n \nAll stoc k must be stored in the designated storage areas immediately after it has been \ndated and rotated.  Dry groceries, canned goods, and paper products must be placed in \ndry storage.  Perishable foods must be refrigerated or frozen immediately.  \n \nStorage and Rot ation  \n \n1. Label all products immediately upon delivery to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) \nrotation procedures are followed.  \n2. All perishable foods must be refrigerated immediately upon delivery.  \n3. To ensure a food safe product temperature, equip all refrigeration units with \nthermometers and check at each shift change.   \nWalk -in cooler, salad bar and coolers:  36 - 40\u00b0 F  \nFreezers: 0 -10\u00b0 F  \n4. Properly store food items in the walk -in cooler and freezer to minimize \ncontamination.  To prevent spoilage and to ensure proper rotation, do not place new \nproduct directly on top of the previously thawed products.  \n5. Know and follow all shelf life guidelines.  Any product that is not used before its \nexpiration date must  be discarded.  \n6. Do not store containers directly on the floor.  Items must be stored at least 6\u201d off the \nfloor for sanitation purposes.  Check with your local Health Department for \nrequirements.  \n7. In storing foods, permit free circulation of cool air on all s urfaces.  \n8. Check all food items daily for spoilage.  \n \nDry Storage  \n \n1. Dry storage items must be kept in a cool, dry (70 -80\u00b0 F) area to prevent spoilage and \nswelling of canned goods.  \n2. Dry storage areas must be kept clean and free of rodents and insects.  This means that \nall walls, ceilings, and floor openings must be sealed or otherwise protected.  \n3. All products must be arranged to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) rotation \nprocedures are followed.  Arrangement of shelves must be in accordance with that of \nthe inventory worksheet.  \n \nFood Handling Guidelines  \n \nThe best way to control the spread of bacteria is:  \n \n1. Cleanliness of food handlers - Hand washing -Glove usage  \n2. Proper sanitation in the kitchen.  \n3. Minimize exposure of opened or prepared foods to room temperatu re. \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  46 \n \n \nTeam Member Sanitation Guidelines  \n \n1. Practice good personal hygiene habits. WASH HANDS with soap and water for a \nminimum of 20 seconds  before and after handling food, going to  the restroom, using \ncleaning or other chemicals, smoking, handling money, handling raw meats, coughing \nor sneezing, picking up items off the floor, touching your hair, face, or other parts of \nyour body.  Restrooms must have a sign posted reminding Team Members to wash \ntheir hands.  \n2. Never let food come in contact with sores or cuts. Team Members must use proper \ncolored bandages and finger cots.  \n3. Properly refrigerate food to 40\u00b0 F or below; thoroughly heat or cook food to 140\u00b0 F or \nabove to ensure food remains within the food safeness range.  \n4. Prepare only one day\u2019s anticipated usag e of any food item according to the Manager \u2019s \nPreparation List.  \n5. DO NOT add raw ingredients to foods that receive no further cooking.  \n6. DO NOT cross -contaminate different types of foods. This usually happens through \nmishandling or misuse of common cooking ut ensils or equipment.  \n7. DO NOT refreeze any product, which has previously thawed.  \n8. All food contact surfaces must be cleaned after every use with a clean, hot towel and \nan approved sanitized rinse (such as bleach/water solution).  \n9. Wear proper hair restraints to  meet Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s  standards  and Health \nDepartment regulations to prevent contaminating food with hair.  \n10. Investigate suspected contamination for determination of food safeness: suspect \nproducts must be discarded.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  47 \n \nKeys To Prevent Guests Getting Food -Borne Illness:  \n \n\uf0b7 Use sanitizer to clean all areas. Towels must be in hand or sanitizer bucket.  \n\uf0b7 Rotate sanitizer buckets a minimum of every 30 minutes or as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Keep raw and cooked food out of danger zone at all times.  \n\uf0b7 Team Members consistently wash  their hands for at least 20 seconds.  \n\uf0b7 Check product temperatures every hour on the hour.  \n\uf0b7 Thoroughly complete  Open -Mid-Close checklists.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all OMC checklists for documentation purposes.  \n\uf0b7 Constantly changing out gloves.  \n\uf0b7 While running the 8 steps look to en sure compliance of food handling.  \n\uf0b7 Aprons are changed as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your thermometer is calibrated.  \n\uf0b7 Use tongs to handle chicken.  \n\uf0b7 Use proper color cutting boards  \n\uf0b7 With any Guest issues follow risk management procedures 100% and inform the \nunits GM.  \n\uf0b7 When inspections are done by health department shadow the inspector and make \nimmediate impact on any violations. SHOW A SENSE OF URGENY.  \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  48 \n \nJOB SAFETY  \n \nThe goal of every safety and health program is to provide a safe workplace and to \nprevent:  \n1. Accidents.  \n2. Injury.  \n3. Job-related illness.  \n \nManagers want to prevent accidents realizing that accident prevention and efficient \nproduction go together.  Managers must take the necessary steps to ensure that their \nTeam Members have a safe place to work and that they foll ow work safety procedures.  \n \nMajor concerns in accident prevention are:  \n \n1. Making the workplace as safe as possible.  \n2. Controlling Team Member action.  \n \nMost accidents are caused by inappropriate behavior on the part of the Team Member, \nrather than uncontrollable physical conditions.  Accidents  usually occur because a Team \nMember acted improperly or was in violation of Company safety rules or its policies.  \n \nTo make Team Members truly safety -conscious, the manager must:  \n \n1. Make Team Members aware  of safety.  \n2. Reinforce the concept in face -to-face relationships with Team Members.  \n \nSafety responsibilities of management:  \n \n1. Develop, maintain, teach, and enforce safety  procedures consistently every day.  \n2. Identification of possible hazardous areas.  \n3. Keeping the workplace and machinery in safe condition.  \n4. Establishing and enforcing safe work methods for Team Members.  \n5. Instructing Team Members in safe job performance.  \n6. Follow -up to ensure Team Members continue to meet safety requirements.  \n7. Providing a good example of safe working habits.  \n8. Understanding in dealing with Team Members who are unresponsive to safety \npractices.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  49 \n \nTo minimize the adverse effects of accidents and prevent their recurrence you must:  \n \n1. Maintain all required first aid items in first aid kit . \n2. Display emergency procedures  including emergency phone numbers for police, \nparamedics and fire departments.  \n3. Train Team Members to:  \na. Follow emergency procedures.  \nb. Prom ptly report every accident.  \n4. Gather, analyze, and report information regarding an accident.  \n5. Take action  on the results of an accident investigation to prevent recurrence  of a \nsimilar accident.  \n6. Maintain a working environment that has no safety or health haza rds. \n7. Communicate  with employees in a manner that minimizes episodes of highly \nemotional behavior that often results in accidents.  \n \nEach manager must establish additional Team Member safety training .  Films are \navailable from your local fire department.  \n \nCostly Injuries:  \n \nThe primary accidents within our industry are:  \n \n1. Injuries that occur due to improper lifting procedures.  These injuries are normally the \nMOST COSTLY in work -time loss, medical treatment and claims.  \n2. Injuries due to a slip or fall on a wet floor.  \n3. Injuries by cuts, i.e., punctures, scrapes, lacerations.  \n4. Injuries by burns due to scalding or heat/cold exposure.  \n \nThese accidents result in:  \n \n1. Time lost by injured Team Member.  \n2. Lost time by fellow Team Members who stop to aid an injured co -worker or  those \nwho stop out of curiosity.  \n3. Lost production.  \n4. Spoilage or damage to inventory.  \n5. Property damage.  \n6. Hiring and training of a replacement Team Member.  \n7. Resulting loss of business.  \n8. Valuable time spent by company Management investigating cause of accident.  \n9. Unfavorable publicity.  \n10. Lowered Team Member morale.  \n11. Unfavorable impact on bottom line profit.  \n12. Personal discomfort and inconvenience to the injured Team Member.  \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  50 \n \nDo it the Safe Way  \n \nHere are some pointers management can use at a safety training session for food service \nTeam Members concerning the four most prevalent types of accidents that occur in food \nservice operations.  \n \nStrains due to improper lifting  \n \n1. Lift trays or any object, using the leg muscle, not your back.  (See lifting procedures ) \n \nFalls  \n1. Keep fl oors clean; wipe up spilled foods, grease, etc.  immediately . \n2. Keep floors and aisles clear of obstructions.  \n3. Do not  stand on boxes, tables, or chairs to reach objects.  Use proper size ladder or \nstep stool .  Do not overreach . \n4. When carrying anything, do not allow your view to become blocked.  \n \nCuts  \n1. Use knives properly ; keep them sharp.  \n2. If a knife falls, do not  try to catch it.  Let it fall . \n3. Use care in removing broken glass.  Don\u2019t pick it up \u2014sweep it up! Remove  slivers \nwith dampened paper.  \n4. Never hand -feed slicing machines.  \n5. Use cut gloves at all times.  \n \nBurns  \n1. Assume that every pot or steam table pan is hot. \n2. Keep handles turned  inward . \n3. Open hot water or other hot liquid faucets slowly to avoid splashes . \n4. Tip pot covers toward you  to release steam in opposite d irection . \n5. Get assistance  where necessary to handle heavy, hot utensils . \n \nLifting Procedures  \n \nChin UP!  This automatically puts the back into a position ready for lifting.  \n \nFeet \n \nPlace feet about as far apart as the width of your musters with one foot a little ahead of \nthe other.  Stand directly facing the object  to be lifted, and as close to the object as \npossible.  \n \nThe farther away from the load you stand, the more strain it puts on your back.   For \nexample, assume the weight of the load is 20 pounds and you have to stand three feet  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  51 \n \naway in order to lift it.  The strain of lifting it is equal to the weight of the load times the \ndistance, or 20 lbs. x 3 ft = 60 lbs.  Not an easy lift anymore is it?  \n \nKnees  \n \nBend your knees  to help you straddle the load and develop leverage  as you pick it up or \nput it down.  In the bent position, get as close to the load  as possible.  \n \nBack  \n \nThe back actually must be referred to as the spinal column and back muscles.  The spinal \ncolumn is mad e up of bones; the cushiony, spongy discs between the bones; the \nligaments; and the muscles that hold the bones upright and together.  \n \nWhen your spinal column is held correctly,  it can support a substantial amount of weight; \nalthough when you bend or twist  your spinal column to lift something, the bones are \n\u201ctilted\u201d and unable to bear as great a load.  Twisting the body  in order to pick up or put \ndown a load can lead to back injury .   Remember to lift the object gradually .  Jerky lifting \nmotions  can put a s udden strain on the spinal column or muscles and cause injury . \n \nHands and Fingers  \n \nProperly gripping the object to be lifted is very important.  Use one hand underneath to \nsupport the load.  Place the other across the top and grip the far edge.  Avoid gett ing your \nfingers pinched when you put down the object by setting one corner down first.  While \ncarrying a carton, DO NOT attempt to ADJUST YOUR GRIP WHILE IN MOTION.  \nSTOP, REST it on a support, and THEN make the change.  \n \nStomach  \n \nAbdominal  as well as back  muscles play a part in lifting.  Too heavy a load or sudden \ntwists can cause a strain in the abdominal muscles.  \n \nIf the load is too heavy, get help ; either a material moving device such as hand truck or \nforklift, or another person.  Two or more people lif ting a load requires  teamwork .  If one \nperson on the \u201cteam\u201d lifts too soon, shifts the load, or lowers the load improperly , either \nperson may be overloaded or overstrained.  It is wiser to decide in advance who will give \nthe orders to coordinate all the moves.  Once the order is given, don\u2019t change your mind \nat the last second to get a better grip or shift your position!  This has been the cause of \nmany accidents.  \n \nWhen carrying objects, many people rest the object against their stomachs to lighten the \nload.  In doing this, they will be leaning backward causing the spinal column to be bent, \nthus putting unnecessary stress on both their muscles and spine.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  52 \n \nEyes  \n \nDon\u2019t allow the load you\u2019re carrying to block your vision causing you to trip over unseen \nobjects . \n \nThe answer to all the following questions must be \u201cyes\u201d prior to lifting and carrying a \nheavy or bulky load:  \n \n1. Is the route to be taken clear and properly illuminated both upstairs and downstairs?  \n2. Is the object free of nails, sharp corners, loose metal straps or splinters?  \n3. Am I wearing the protective equipment to handle it safely, i.e. gloves, apron, goggles \nor foot protection?  \n4. Am I remembering to place the short object on top of the long, and the narrow on top \nof the wide?  \n \nSummation  \n \nThe lifting position for each person will vary slightly depending on their height and \nweight.  The key points to remember are:  \n \n1. Check the planned route.  Decide on how to best grasp the object and make sure the \nload is easily within your lifting capacity.  \n2. Position fee t and squat close to the load.  \n3. Get a good grip and lift gradually using your leg muscles as much as possible and the \nleverage created by your bent knee.  Keep the load close to the body.  \n4. Make sure the object is close to you when lifting and keep it close w hen carrying.  \nMake sure you can see where you are going.  \n \nReceiving and Storing  \n \n1. When opening boxes, crates, etc, use the proper tool designed for removing nails, \nwire, or sharp metal bands.  Remove these objects and discard immediately.  \n2. Store heavy material on bottom shelves, medium weight on the next shelves, \nlightweight and breakables on top.  \n3. Keep food containers covered in refrigerators when not in use.  \n4. When opening edibles, examine for possible foreign matter.  \n5. In handling boxes, crates, or any fo od material follow rules for safe lifting.  Use \nladders to reach for anything too high for you.  Do not stand on crates, boxes, or \ntrashcans.  \n6. Use handles to open and close drawers.  \n7. Store all insecticides, pesticides, disinfectants, and washing compounds in  areas away \nfrom food or food -handling areas.  Do not store on shelves above food preparation or \nfood-handling areas.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  53 \n \n8. All walk -in boxes must have a bump handle release.  When coming out of a walk -in \nbox, open door gradually.  \n \nThe Kitchen  \n \n1. Grills, fryers, blenders, freezers, and slicers can all cause accidents if mishandled.  \n2. Never allow any machine to be used unless the Team Member has been trained to use \nit properly.  Make certain that all safety devices are in place before using.  \n3. Do not wear loose clothin g (open shirt, sleeves, neckties, apron strings) or jewelry \naround any machinery or equipment.  \n4. Pull plug on any piece of equipment that is not direct -wired or throw breaker on any \ndirect -wired piece of machinery before cleaning or adjusting any machine.  \n5. Keep fingers, hands, knives or spoons away from moving parts.  \n6. Keep fingers, hands and arms out of all equipment.  \n7. All electrical kitchen equipment must be grounded.  \nKnives  \n \n1. The sharper the knife, the less chance of injury.  It cuts more easily, takes less \npressure, and has less chance of slipping.  \n2. Pick knives up by the handle, never by the blade.  Put them away in racks when not in \nuse.  Never cover them with a cloth, even tempo rarily; you may forget they are there.  \n3. In handling knives:  \na. Cut away from your body or hand.  \nb. Use cut glove at all times  \nc. When drying a knife, keep the sharp edge away from you.  \nd. Never leave knives in the sink or water, or where they cannot be easily seen.  \ne. Properly dispose of all knives that are worn, broken, or have loose handles.  \n4. Do not put dirty knives into a tub of soapy water where it cannot be seen.  \nSomeone may reach in and cut themselves.  \nFloors  \n \n1. Spilled liquids, grease and food cause most slips and fal ls in the kitchen area.  \n2. Keep floors clean and dry.  \n3. If you spill it \u2013 wipe it up immediately!  \n4. If you drop it \u2013 pick it up immediately!  \n5. Tile floors may be slippery when the weather is humid.  Take special care to avoid \nslips and falls.  Wipe tile floors periodically when weather is humid.  \n6. Shoes - wear proper shoes such as rubber or crepe soles (must say non -slip on the \nbox) to avoid slips and falls.  \n7. Walk; do not run across the floor.  \n8. Keep floor clear of utensils, boxes, or pieces of food.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  54 \n \nTrash disposal  \n \n1. Do not let containers overflow.  \n2. Keep garbage can lids on tightly.  \n3. If plastic disposal bags are used, be sure that they are tied securely.  \n4. All lids from can must be put back into the can or in a box so when you compact \ngarbage with your hand you do not cut yourself.  \n \nDining Room Area  \n \n1. Subdued lighting must never be so dim that movement required for serving is unsafe.  \n2. A routine inspection conducted at least once a day must be established to inspect \nchairs, stools, counters, and tables for broken parts, splint ers, and loose joints. If such \nfaulty items are found, they must be removed from the area and repaired or replaced.  \nHygiene and Sanitation  \n \nIn eight hours, one bacteria cell, under certain conditions, can multiply into a family of \nover thirty -five trillion, causing food poisoning to your customers.  \nThis is an extremely threatening condition for a business.  There are two things that must \nbe done to control bacteria and prevent hazardous conditions.  \n \n1. Insist Team Members follow good personal hygien e and sanitation procedures.  \n2. Keep food refrigerated and covered.  In this way, the amount of bacteria that is \nalready present or enters the food is controlled.  Proper refrigeration ---below 40\u00b0F \nretards the rapid multiplication of bacteria.  Maintaining  a temperature of 140\u00b0 F or \nover discourages bacteria in hot foods.  \n \nTeam Members must be checked out by the medical department or a doctor if they have \nthe following symptoms:  \n \n1. Gastrointestinal disorders.  \n2. Sore throat or persistent cough.  \n3. Skin lesions, boi ls on hands or other parts of body.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  55 \n \nTeam Members must be made aware of the importance of washing their hands often with \nsoap and hot water.  Specifically, hands must be washed:  \n \n1. After using restrooms.  \n2. After smoking.  \n3. Anytime you touch your hair or skin.  \n4. Before any food prep activity.  \n5. After handling money.  \n6. After busing tables.  \n7. After mopping or sweeping.  \n8. After putting stock away.  \n9. Upon return from a break.  \n10. Before you clock into work.  \n11. After emptying trash.  \n12. After daily cleanup.  \n13. Before handling any food or clean utensils.  \n \nIn other words, anytime you may have picked up bacteria from a non -sanitary surface.  \nWashing hands often with soap and water and drying them with a sanitary towel will \nreduce the transfer of harmful bacteria from your hands to other food contact surfaces.  \nSummation  \n \nHeat hot foods to over 140\u00b0 F as fast as possible and keep them at that temperature or \nchill them as quickly as possible.  Cold foods must be chilled to below 40\u00b0 F as quickly \nas possible.  Do not prolong preparation of foods.  Deviating from the desirable \ntemperatures for too long invites bacteria that we try to control.  \n \nHere are three rules to follow concerning food safety and sanitation:  \n \n1. Keep it hot or keep it cold.  \n2. Keep it covered.  \n3. When in doubt\u2026throw it out!  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  56 \n \nGeneral Electrical Safety  \n \n1. Use quality electrical equipment; look for the underwriters label (signifying approved \nby the underwriters laboratory) on the equipment.  \n2. Only qualified electricians must be permitted to perform electrical work.  \n3. Stay off wet or da mp footing areas when using electrical appliances.  Do not use \nelectrical equipment while standing in the rain.  Keep your hands dry.  \n4. Use the appropriate sizes of electrical cords (light or heavy -duty).  \n5. Never pull the plug out of an outlet by yanking the c ord. \n6. Motors must be used in accordance with their designated horsepower - do not \noverload.  \n7. Any small shocks from equipment are a warning of leaking electricity and must be \nrepaired immediately.  \n8. All portable electric tools must be grounded and their power always turned off when \nnot in use.  \n9. Set up a preventative maintenance inspection system for electrical equipment to \nprevent electrical hazards before someone is injured.  \n10. All electrical installations and utilization of equipment shall be installed and \nmainta ined in accordance with the provision of the national electrical code nfpa 70 -\n1968 (ansi -c-i-1968).  \n \nFire Hazards  \n \nIn the event of a fire occurring at a restaurant, it is up to the management to take charge \nof the situation.  Fires vary greatly is size and  nature, sound judgment must be applied.  \nIn general, there are two major objectives to be accomplished:  \n \n1. Eliminate the danger to customers and employees.  \n2. Minimize damage to the store premises.  \n \nFire Prevention  \n \n1. Keep combustible material and supplies a saf e distance from hot water heaters and \nother cooking equipment.  \n2. Practice good housekeeping at all times.  \n3. Clean filters and hoods on cooking equipment on a regular basis.  \n4. Check gas jets and pilot lights frequently.  Promptly report any odor of gas.  \n5. Do not ov erload outlets or use temporary wiring.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  57 \n \nFire Emergency Plan  \n \nThe key to the success of any emergency plan during an actual emergency is that store \npersonnel are given specific responsibilities and instructed on how to perform these \nduties before the eme rgency occurs.  \n \n1. Train all Team Members in the use of the fire extinguishers.  \n2. Show all Team Members where the gas cut -offs are and how to turn off the gas \nmains.  Keep a wrench or pliers near that location.  \n3. Show all Team Members where the circuit breakers are.  Ensure that the markings are \nclear.  \n4. Pre-arrange responsibilities in the event of a fire.  \n \nAccidents and New Employees  \n \nSurveys show that 60 percent of all accidents involve Team Members who have been \nwith a company less than one year.  In the restaurant business, at any given time, there \nare a number of Team Members working in our restaurants that are relatively new.  They  \nwork during peak periods, full -time and part -time.  Therefore, extra effort must be made \nto make the Team Members \u201csafe for the job and the job safe for the Team Members\u201d.  \n \nThe first step is to carefully interview the applicant, and determine that the per son is \nsuited to do the job.  \n \nOnce management has ascertained that the applicant is qualified, the next step is to make \ncertain that the new Team Members receives all the proper safety instructions.  \n \nStress that each Team Member is responsible for his/her owns safety and obeying safety \nrules is a condition of employment!  \n \nNew Team Member safety indoctrination must not stop here.  \n \nBeginning with the Team Members first day at work, the manager must spend time \npointing out safety procedures and potentially uns afe conditions that may be encountered \non the job.  Stress the importance of having a \u201csafe job\u201d attitude.  \n \nThe number of part -time personnel employed by Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s places  additional \nimportance on the need for thorough safety training.  Many part -time Team Members are \nstudents who have already completed a full day in class when they arrive at work.  They \nmust adjust to a completely different environment.  It is imperative that our safety \nprocedures and regulations be reviewed periodically with Tea m Members.  Only in this \nway can we prevent injury and retain our excellent safety record.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  58 \n \nAccident Investigating and Reporting  \n \nAccident investigation is a fact -finding process.  The objective of an accident report is to:  \n \n1. Obtain complete and true information about the alleged accident or incident.  \n2. Identify hazardous conditions and unsafe acts or practices.  \n3. Give the accident investigator as much as possible to help process the claim.  \n \nKeep the Atmosphere of the Investigation Informal.  \n \n1. Do not put the verbal comments of witnesses in writing while they are giving their \naccounts of the accident.  \n2. Wait until you are away from witnesses to write your report.  You can always check \nyour written report with them to verify that the facts they reported ar e accurate.  \n \nUse Common Sense:  Stick to the Facts.  \n \n1. Make no assumptions and take nothing for granted.  \n2. Do not look upon the accident investigation as additional work, but rather as an \nopportunity to correct an unsafe situation.  \n \nInvestigate Each Sequence.  \n \nAn apparently reasonable conclusion will often be changed by exploring facts that were \nnot considered important enough to be mentioned.  \n \nCheck for Unsafe Conditions and Actions.  \n \nState what unsafe conditions contributed to the accident. They are always pr esent when \naccidents occur.  Give reasons for their existence, if possible.  List any unsafe acts \ninvolved.  Why did they occur?  Note: never accept an investigation report that says an \nemployee was \u201ccareless\u201d.  This is a result, never a cause.  If you thi nk the employee was \ncareless, find out why.  There is always a cause.  \n \nMake the necessary recommendations for corrective action to your supervisor and send a \ncopy to the corporate insurance department.  \n \nFollow up to see that the corrective recommendations have been put into effect.  \n \nThe following questions and answers will help you in accident investigations.  \n \n1. Which accidents must be investigated? All of them.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  59 \n \n2. When must the accident investigation be made? Immediately after the accident.  \nDelays can permit p ertinent evidence to be removed or change and important \ninformation forgotten.  \n3. What questions are necessary to accident investigation?  There are six basic questions \nthat must be answered:  \na. Who was injured?  \nb. When did it happen?  \nc. Why did it occur?  \nd. What were th e unsafe conditions or unsafe practices involved?  \ne. Where did it happen?  \nf. How did it happen?  \n4. Must separate accident reports be used for Team Member and Guest accidents? Yes.  \nCertain types of information for one do not have to be recorded for the other.  (See  \nsections of employee injury and public injury).  \n5. Who must investigate accidents? The store manager is the most logical person to \nmake the investigation.  The manager is best informed concerning every phase of \nwork operations in the restaurant.  Accident pr evention is proper safety training, \nsupervision and follow -up. \n \nTeam Member Injury Procedures  \n \nWhen a Team Member is injured while working, the manager or person in charge must:  \n1. Do whatever can be done to ob tain the extent of injury without further injuri ng the \nTeam Member?  \n2. Correct any unsafe conditions to prevent a recurrence of the accident.  \n3. Require Team Member to receive first aid and/or medical treatment.  Even minor \ninjuries must receive first aid to prevent them from turning into serious problems.  \n4. If Team Member goes to a doctor/hospital, do not allow him/her to return to work \nwithout a doctor\u2019s release.  \n \nSerious Injuries  \n \n1. Call an ambulance and/or doctor.  If Team Member can be moved without risking \nfurther injury, take them to our medical care provider in your area.  \n2. Notify a relative or close friend of the injured person.  (Check employment \napplication for emergency information).  \n3. Call your Supervisor immediately.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  60 \n \nInstruct the Team Member who goes to a medical care provider to:  \n \n1. Report or have  someone report to you the status of the injury/illness and the \nappropriate return -to-work date.  \n2. Have the medical care provider complete a return to work slip before returning to \nwork.  \n3. Schedule checkups following the injury/illness during non -scheduled wor k hours.  \n \nReport of Injury  \n \nWhenever a Team Member accident occurs, a record of the accident must be immediately \nsupplied to our insurance company.       \n \nYou will be talking to various individuals, the injured Team Member, as well as other \nTeam Members an d witnesses.  Your goal in the investigation is not to establish fault, but \nto establish and correct the cause.  Employees will omit vital points in their exchanges \nwith management if they fear repercussions from their statements, either from their \nmanager  or fellow Team Members.  \n \nInformation required in completing the first report of injury:  \n \n1. Team Member name and social security number.  Both are mandatory.  \n2. Restaurant location.  Give the location of the Team Members permanently assigned \nstore.  \n3. Occupation/job assignment at time of accident.  \n4. Date and time of injury or initial diagnosis of injury.  Mandatory.  Include hour, and \n\u201cam\u201d or \u201cpm.\u201d  \n5. Did Team Member return to work on next scheduled shift?  An answer is necessary \neven if Team Member does not  miss any days.  \n6. Date returned to work.  Give actual date Team Member returned to work or doctor\u2019s \nrelease date if it precedes return -to-work date.  If this is unknown at the time of \nreport, notify area office as soon as the date is known.  If Team Member t erminates, \nindicate termination date.  \n \nWorkdays scheduled per week  \n \nThis must be filled in as accurately as possible.  If unknown or not always the same use \naverage number of days worked per week or number of days Team Member was \nscheduled during week of a ccident.  Unless noted otherwise, it will be assumed that an 8 -\nhour shift was scheduled.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  61 \n \nLength of Service with Company  \n \nThe total time the Team Member has been employed without a break in service.  \n \nRate of Pay  \n \nThe rate of pay for the Team Member is on  an hourly basis and daily basis.  \n \nAddress Where Accident Occurred and Store Number  \n \nGive address of accident and store number whether it is Team Member is permanently \nassigned store or a temporary duty store.  \n \nCan Team Member Perform Regular Job?  \n \n1. Was Team Member assigned to another job on a temporary basis?  \n2. Did Team Member work at a permanent assignment, but could not perform all duties \nnormally connected with it?  If no, state days unable to work.  Record only scheduled \nworkdays.  \n \nDid Team Member Term inate or Transfer as a Result of Accident?  \n \nIndicate if Team Member terminates or transfers after accident and if it would have been \na lost time accident (a lost time accident is one in which Team Member misses scheduled \nwork time due to accident.)  \n \nRecomm endation to Prevent Future Occurrence  \n \nMake recommendations which you feel will help to prevent a recurrence of this incident \n(e.g. use of available safety equipment if not in use at the time of incident; suggested \nsafety equipment not now available; re -training; equipment replacement or maintenance, \netc.) \n \nDate Accident Reported to Supervisor  \n \nShow date Team Members supervisor was informed of accident (e.g. either manager or \nassistant manager).  Show date of report, your name and title.  \n \nSupplemental Accident Report  \n \nA supplemental accident report is used to report the following in conjunction with a \nwork -related accident:  \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  62 \n \n1. An injury/illness which was originally reported as a \u201cno lost time\u201d accident but \ndevelops into a \u201clost time\u201d accident.  \n2. Lost time subsequent to reported return -to-work date; e.g. Team Member returns to \nwork, date is reported, and then employee loses time due to accident three days after \nreported return date.  \n3. Termination when Team Member does not return after a work -related injury/ill ness.  \n4. Corrections or additions to the data recorded on the Team Member accident report.  \nWhen any of the above conditions exist:  \n \n1. Request a supplemental accident report from the supervisor.  \n2. Complete each item on form.  \n3. Return the completed form to the proper  supervisor.  \n \nPublic Injury :  Injury to persons other than Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s personnel  \n \nExamples:  \n \n1. A Guest claims a slippery floor caused him to fall in the store.  \n2. A Guest claims a foreign object in her food caused a broken tooth.  \n3. A Guest claims hot food/plate caused a burn.  \n4. A Guest chokes on food.  \n \nPersonal Property Damage  \n \nThe loss or damage to property of others. Examples:  \n \n1.

A Team Member spills a drink on a custome r\u2019s clothing and customer makes a claim \nfor damage to clothing.  \nManagement Responsibility  \n \nTo protect the company against unnecessary claims of loss, damage, or injury:  \n \n1. Be courteous but make no statements about who is liable in the case of public injury \nor personal damage.  \n2. Obtain and report accurate information regarding the incident.  \n3. Make certain Team Members are trained in emergency procedures.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  63 \n \nAction  \n \nIn case of public injury or personal property damage, the person in charge must adhere to \nthe following:  \n1. Make certain no liability statements are made by store personnel.  It is extremely \nimportant that neither store management nor Team Members make a statement \nregarding the cause of accident or payment for damages.  The only statement that \nmust be  made is that a report will be submitted to the corporate office for evaluation \nand the person will be contacted.  \n2. Correct any conditions which might have caused the incident to prevent a recurrence.  \n3. Fill out a Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \u201cCustomer  Accident Report Form\u201d.  \n \nYou will be talking to the customer, to witnesses, and possibly medical personnel to \ndetermine the accident -causing facts.  Be sure to include:  \n \n1. Name, address, phone number and driver\u2019s license number of persons involved, \nincluding  witnesses.  \n2. Description and license number of any vehicle involved in an accident.  \n3. Date, time and conditions of the accident.  \n4. Any other pertinent data.  \n5.

Accident caused by an aircraft.  \nManagement Responsibilities  \n \nTo prevent and minimize the damage  to the store and avoid unnecessary costs:  \n \n1. Make no liability statements.  \n2. Obtain and report accurate information regarding the incident.  \n3. Make certain that employees are trained in emergency procedures.  \n4. Prevent recurrence of similar incidents.  \n \nAction  \n \nIn the case of store property damage, the manager or person in charge must adhere to the \napplicable measures:  \n \n1. Correct any conditions which could cause injury, further loss or damage.  \n2. When conditions interrupt store operation, immediately contact the area man ager.  \n3. When someone damages store property.  Make no statement other than to say a report \nwill be submitted to the area office for evaluation.  The company does not expect to \npay for the damage if it is someone else\u2019s fault.  Avoid such statements as: \u201cdon\u2019 t \nworry about it, it\u2019s been hit before\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, it won\u2019t cost much.\u201d \nDo not threaten arrest if damages are not paid, as your threat constitutes extortion.  \nPunishment for vandalism is a criminal matter; filing suit for damages is a civil  \nmatter.  \n4. For the company to recover money for losses, obtain and record as much information \nas possible, such as:  \n \n\uf0b7 Name, address, phone number and driver\u2019s license number of persons involved, \nincluding witnesses.  \n\uf0b7 Description and license number of any vehic le involved in an accident.  \n\uf0b7 List and description of damaged items.  \n\uf0b7 Date, time and conditions of the accident.  \n\uf0b7 Any other pertinent data.  \n \nMake certain all Team Members are trained to make no liability statements and \nto gather all pertinent data.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  65 \n \nSecurity  \n \nRegister Security  \n \nSince you work with money, you must also be concerned with robbery, internal theft or \nshort -change artists.  This is a serious subject, and you must follow these procedures very \ncarefully to maintain proper safekeeping of the restauran t\u2019s employees and assets.  \n \nWhen leaving the register for any reason, keep both security and customers in mind.  This \nmeans you must:  \n\uf0b7 Lock the register . \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the register and on the line for upcoming guest.  \n\uf0b7 Never keep guest waiting at the register .  \n \nIn addition, you must keep the register locked when you\u2019re not at the cashier station to \nkeep delivery or service personnel (or even fellow employees) from opening the register \nand taking money from the register.  Often it\u2019s hard to believe one of your  fellow workers \nwould steal money, but it does occasionally happen.  Remember, you will be held \naccountable for shortages in your cash drawer.  \n \nShort -change Artists  \n \nDO NOT interrupt a transaction to discuss anything. Quick change artists and \ncounterfeiters may try to get you confused.  Sometimes they work in pairs.  \n1. If interrupted, say: \u201cJust a moment, please.  I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d  \n2. Finish transaction.  \n3. Then say: \u201c Thank you for waiting.  How may I help you?\u201d  \n4. If, when you are counting back money they interrupt to ask for additional change or \nfor additional purchase, tell them you will take care of them as soon as you finish \ncounting back their money.  Criminals often  try to confuse the CASHIER with an \ninterruption.  DON\u2019T let it happen to you.  \n\uf0b7 DO NOT take money from two people at the same time.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the bill on the register shelf until you finish transaction.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the drawer closed when ringing up the order.  \n \nIf they give you currency that has handwriting or any other obvious marks on it, make a \ncasual comment about it.  Some quick -change artists work in pairs in order to have the \nfirst one use a larger denomination marked bill, and when the second one comes th rough \nthe line, he will use a smaller bill.  But once the change has been given, and the drawer is \nclosed, he will politely say there may have been a mistake and he gave you a larger bill.  \nTo convince you, he will even refer to a specific handwritten note  or mark on the larger \nbill.  You look in your drawer and find the very bill he is referring to, and if you hadn\u2019t  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  66 \n \nnoticed it before, you may feel compelled to return the extra change.  After all, he sounds \nso convincing and so harmless.  \n \nCounterfeit Mone y \n \nCounterfeiters usually deal only with large bills (i.e. Twenties, fifties, hundreds) although \noccasionally they will use $5 or $10 bills.  \n \nConsult with your manager on how to recognize counterfeit bills.  If you suspect you \nhave been given a counterfei t bill, you must do the following:  \n\uf0b7 Do not  return it to the Guest until the manager has instructed you to do so.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  physically grab the Guest. This could lead to a lawsuit if the money is \nNOT counterfeit!  \n\uf0b7 Do not  accuse the Guest.  You are not a government agent, so don\u2019t try to act like \none.  \n\uf0b7 Call the manager immediately . \n \nRobbery  \n \nIf a robbery occur s at the register during business hours, it is important to remember one \nword \u201c Cooperate\u201d.   Do not try to be a hero or resist a robbery attempt.  Your life is more \nvaluable than the money in the drawer.  \n \nIf a robbery must occur, do the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Do whatever the robber asks within reason.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and avoid sudden movements.  \n\uf0b7 Give the robber all the money in the register.  \n\uf0b7 Be alert and notice features (height, weight, attire, color of eyes, scars, etc\u2026) \ndon\u2019t  be obvious about this ! \n\uf0b7 Contact the manager immediately after they leave and have someone call the \npolice.  \n \nSome things you can do to red uce the risks of robbery:  \n \n\uf0b7 Be aware of suspicious -acting guests.  \n\uf0b7 Be suspicious of guests who ask questions about how much business you do each \nday, who stare at the money in the drawer, or who linger near the cashier area for \nno apparent reason, or people who stay in the restaurant for a long period of time \nwithout eati ng or drinking anything.  \n\uf0b7 Make frequent money drops during your shift, removing all large bills from your \nregister. Check with your manager on how and when to do this.  \n\uf0b7 Keep the cash register door closed at all times except when conducting sales \ntransactio ns.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  67 \n \n\uf0b7 Keep the register key in a hidden location.  \n \nSecurity in our units is paramount. There are factions in our society that will try and \ninitiate criminal activities against restaurants. Please read carefully and do not put your \nunit, management staff or team members in harm\u2019s way.  \n \nOpening Procedures  \n\uf0b7 In the morning, circle the building in your vehicle checking to see if all the doors \nare secured before entering. When in doubt be cautious, don\u2019t go in. Call the \npolice to clear the building before entering.   \n \nDeposits and Cash Handling  \n \nWhen making a deposit, try to vary the time you go to the bank. Do not let it be routine. \nMake deposits during the daylight hours.  When going to the bank be aware of any \nsuspicious looking vehicles. If you identify any, ride  by and come back at a different \ntime.  \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on bushes, trees or any other obstacles that could be used as a place \nto hide while waiting for a depositor.  \n\uf0b7 Make cash drops regularly so that you never have over $400 in the cash drawer.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving to make a deposit do not run any other errands before making the \ndeposit. Go straight to the bank. Money left in the car is an easy target.  \n\uf0b7 When going to the bank to make a deposit make sure that when coming to a stop \nlight you leave plenty of space in between cars so that you cannot be boxed in \neasily and are able to maneuver your car out of the space.  \n\uf0b7 If there are pedestrians in the vicinity make sure you are aware of their \nmovements and how close they are to your vehicle. Chose the farthest distance \nfrom them.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving with money do not make it apparent that you are carrying a deposit.  \n\uf0b7 If possible when transporting money to or from the unit try to have someone meet \nyou at your car outside the front door while you are in your vehicle. Walking from  \nthe far end of the parking lot with large amounts of money makes you an easy \ntarget.  \n\uf0b7 Always count money in a secure place out of the view of Guest s and Team \nMembers. The office must be used to count money and always have the door \nclosed and locked. Team Members do not need to know the cash handling aspects \nof our business or how much cash may be on the property at a time.  \n\uf0b7 Have 2 drawers available so that the drawers can be switched out seamlessly \nduring the mid shift and the other drawer counted in the of fice. While counting \ndown the AM drawer make sure to have someone monitoring the shift. It must \ntake no longer than 10 minutes to count down the mid shift drawer.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  68 \n \nDeliveries  \n \n\uf0b7 When accepting deliveries, make sure to be aware of the surroundings before \nopening the door. Shut the door securely and then check in the product. Walk the \ndelivery agents to the door and let them out after the surroundings have been \nobserved and then secure the door.  \n\uf0b7 The back door must never be left unattended. A manager must alway s be present.  \n \nStructure Security  \n \n\uf0b7 Locate the main breaker boxes that are outside the building during the day time \nand ensure they are secure. If the lights go out in the building do not run outside. \nThis may be a rouse to get the door open. If lights do go out remain inside, call \nthe polic e to come and check out the building and surrounding before opening the \ndoor.  \n\uf0b7 Install a peep hole on the back door and/or mirrors to allow you to see around \ncorners.  \n\uf0b7 Put an alarm bar on the back door. The alarm bar must always be in place. The \ndoor must remain closed after dark.  \n\uf0b7 If you have cameras make sure they are functioning.  \n\uf0b7 A well -lit place will not be as easy a target. If lights are out around your building mak e \nsure to quickly get them replaced. Criminals will stage their crime scenes well.  \n \n \nPublic Relations  \n \n\uf0b7 Cater to law enforcement guests when they come in. Thank them regularly for the \nhard work they perform and for patrolling your area. The more times you have the \nPolice seen in and around your building the more secure you will be.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  69 \n \nClosing Procedures  \n \n\uf0b7 Leave for the night  in pairs. The last 2 people must follow this procedure. First \nlook both ways out the door and let the first person go.  After they are  secure in \ntheir car and have observed the surroundings, flash your headlights to the person \ninside. The first person out must wait until the second person is safely in their car \nand car is started before leaving. The person inside must be close to a phone  ready \nto call 911 if the first person out is accosted.  Do not hesitate time is crucial.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  allow anybody in th e building after closing except  for those closing the \nshift. This includes off the clock Team Members or family members of someone \nworking. People waiting to give an employee a ride must wait outside.  \n\uf0b7 Do not let the Team Members exit or enter from the back door.  \n\uf0b7 After closing hours, lock the door even if there is still guest in the restaurant. Let \nthem out when they want to go. Be observant of all areas outside before opening \nthe door, someone could be hiding nearby.  \n\uf0b7 Be aware of any suspicious people that come in just before closing.  \n\uf0b7 Make your last trash run before dark and attend the door during the run. During \ndaylight savings time make tra sh runs early in the evening. Leave the last trash \ncontainer inside and dispose of it in the morning. The manager must be present at \nthe door during the trash run to ensure someone is not hiding behind the dumpster \nand then walking your team member in the back door.  \n\uf0b7 Before closing and after the late night guest are out of the front parking spaces \nmove your vehicles closer to the unit. Try and park away from any other cars so \nyou will have a clear view around your vehicle upon leaving. Do not park around \nobstructions in the area such as trees, bushes, landscaping accoutrements etc.  \n\uf0b7 When going to your vehicle make sure your key is in your hand and ready to open \nthe door.  \n\uf0b7 Do not carry numerous items out with you late which will prevent you from \nquickly enter ing your vehicle.  \n\uf0b7 If you have to scrape ice off your windows be observant of your surrounding \nduring the process.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  70 \n \nCrisis Management  \n \nIn the case of a Natural Disasters which would include the following circumstances  \n \n\uf0b7 Tornado  \n\uf0b7 Hurricane  \n\uf0b7 Flood  \n\uf0b7 Major Power Outage  \n \nThe following steps must take place.  \n\uf0b7 Secure the unit by moving all Guests and Team Members away from windows, \ndoors and patio.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and move those in the building to a safe place i.e. Prep area, Walk -\nin Cooler, Restrooms.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all p eople calm and monitor the situation. If possible monitor TV to see the \nstatus and when all is clear for business to resume.  \n \nYour Guests and Team Members will be looking for you to control the situation. During \na team meeting discuss the proper steps that  would be taken if such occurrence takes \nplace.  \n \nIf there is a power outage call the power company to get updates on when power will be \nrestored, it may only be a matter of minutes. As soon the power company is called inform \nyour supervisor and seek knowle dge. \n \nIn the case of Media on Premises regarding a situation the following steps must be taken.  \n \n\uf0b7 Be polite and let them know you need a few minutes.

Do not look at the bottom of \nthis page!  \n \nThe cost of training one hourly Team Member is?  \n \n1. $850  \n2. $980  \n3. $1099  \n4. $1508  \n5. $2077  \n6. $2200 \n7. $2400  \n \nThe cost of losing a family of 4 who had a bad experience and tells 10 of their friends \nwill be lost Top Line  sales of?  \n \n1. $750  \n2. $980  \n3. $1190  \n4. $1800  \n5. $2400  \n6. $5000  \n7. $9000  \n \nThis scenario is based upon a family of 4 with a check average of $25 visiting 3 times per \nmonth. That total would be $75 a month. Assume that this family\u2019s bad experience is \nshared with 10 other families of 4 who will never dine with us because of this 1 bad \nexperience and 1 poor recommendation! Here is how the numbers work:  \n \n$75 per month with each family of 4 dinning 3 times per month times the 10 families!  \nThat number is $750 in lost sales for 1 month. Take that $750 and annualize that!  \nYou have lost $9000 in sales due to 1 bad experience that a Family of 4 had.  \n \nThis scenario could  be very real. It is a fact that for every bad experience a Guest has in \nthe service industry, they tell 10 people! Think about your past negative experiences you \nhad while dinning. Did you go back? Did you tell anyone about your experience?  \n \nThe answer t o question 1 is number 7=$2400! According to People Report  in 2004 the \ncost for training 1 Team Member was $2400. This cost includes: training wages, wages \nto the trainers, cost of management time spent with new hire, cost of uniform, cost of \nmanuals, cost  in food waste, and payroll taxes.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 -

What do you have to do to make \nyour operation a shining example of efficiency and or ganization? We will touch on many \nof the key components needed and give you a checklist of sorts of what responsibilities \nyou need to focus on in order to be a successful General Manager, an asset to \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s, and your Franchisee.  \n \nIt takes hard work, dedication, consistency, perseverance and passion to be a phenomenal \nGeneral Manager. Those who emulate the above will reap the rewards and continue their \njourney to the next level and be successful in obtaining your financial goals.  \n \nTaking pri de in your work and operating with little supervision without constant \naccolades is sometimes the road you must travel. You must be self propelled in finding \nyour way without losing steam in our environment.   \n \nWe will be supplying you with a list of items , task, and challenges that you must be \naware of to be successful. You are not expected to complete all of them, however the \nteam that you build is. As you assign tasks to your fellow managers remember you need \nto develop your team and set the expectations  as well as give them the tools to complete \nthe assignment that you give to them.  \n \nThey will only be successful at the assignment if you set them up for success. You are \ntheir best resource for knowledge and guidance.  \n \nREMEMBER IF THEY LOSE, YOU LOSE!!!  \n \nWhat are the Key Characteristics  of the successful manager?  \n \n\uf0d8 Passionate  \uf0d8 Understanding  \uf0d8 Guest Focused   \n\uf0d8 Self Motivated  \n \n\uf0d8 Sympathetic  \uf0d8 Fast Paced  \uf0d8 Multi -task \noriented   \n\uf0d8 Detail Oriented  \n \n \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 96 \n \nAlong with these Key Characteristic points Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s has created a list of \ncritical points to exceptional management. These Manager Criticals have 11 key points. If \nyou hold yourself and your management team to these standards we will all be winners. \n(It is also suggested that the Manager Criticals be used as a standard when writing \nperformance reviews of your management team).  \n \nAt Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s we believe that setting attainable goals is an intricate part of \nour success. When writing your BURGER goals or your managers are writing their goals \nuse the Key Characteristics and the Manager Criticals as a bench mark in your \npreparation.  \n \nRunning 14 great shifts per week (14/14) is the number one priority for each member of \nthe management team. If we are not running a great 14/14 we run the risk of delivering \npoor service or food to a first time Guest. You as a manager  must ensure the proper \nscheduling coverage is provided in each of those shifts. Your heavy volume shifts will be \nFriday am/pm, Saturday am/pm, and Sunday am/pm. These account for over 60% of your \nbusiness. As the General Manager you want to be on duty these shifts to ensure the Team \nis executing to 100% of the standard.  \n \nThese days are real Game Days, in football terms. Every shift is live and the game has \nbegun! When writing the manager schedule t he General Manager (The Head Coach) must \nbe working each Game Day. It is suggested that Monday morning is the best time for the \nGeneral Manager to be doing administrative office work including:  \n \n\uf0b7 Inventory  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing your key cost areas: Food Cost/Paper/Labo r \n\uf0b7 Doing the weekly Profit loss Statement  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing last week\u2019s  sales  \n\uf0b7 Forecasting the coming week\u2019s sales/labor  \n\uf0b7 Marketing strategy meetings  \n\uf0b7 Holding Manager meetings/suggested 2 per month  \n\uf0b7 Manager or Key Team Member  1on1\u2019s/suggested 4 per month  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing Ord er Books  \n \nThink of this in terms of the head football coach. He is watching films from last week and \nplanning for his upcoming game.  \n \nThe GM/Franchisee must make time to review and get the team focused for the upcoming \nweek.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 97 \n \nQualifying Your Team  \n \nDeveloping your team is one of the best ways to insure your success. Providing the time \nand resources to make someone great promotes you as a great leader and team builder.  \nThis ensures that everybody is knowledgeable and efficient at their jobs. When tea m \nmembers know the expectations and have a knowledge base to draw from they get much \nmore proficient at a task.  Having numerous individuals effective at different positions \ngives you the flexibility to have a maximum impact  on the operation and your shif t. \n \nEach week you must be meeting with your fellow managers to discuss the team\u2019s training \nneeds. Identify who needs development and plan for it. If you don\u2019t have the time to \ndevelop your team you will fight endless battles during each shift. Investing in  training \ntime with your team members will pay off in the form of smoother shifts and increase the \ntime you have to build sales later on.  \n \nYour team members must be tested on each position of the restaurant. You can verbally \nqualify the team by asking ques tions about each task they are performing.  \n \nHuman Resources  \n \nCounseling Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Identify the problem, giving specifics in a calm and friendly fashion.  \n3. Ask the employee for his/her input on the problem, paraphrasing the informatio n \nhe/she provides.  \n4. Ask the employee for a plan.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out the commitments.  \n6. Agree on a time and place to follow -up. \n \nDisciplining Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Review the problem discussed in the previous meeting, what was agreed to, and w hat \nhas happened since.  \n3. Ask the team member for his /her input, paraphrasing the information he/she \nprovides.  \n4. Ask the team member what he/she plans to do.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out commitments.  \n6. Notify the team member of necessary formal procedures.  \n7. Agree on a time and place for follow up.   \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 98 \n \nLeadership  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s managers  represent the ideal team member, and they provide the \nexample from which other team members model their behavior.  Managers must lead by \nexample by showing an excellent work ethic , following Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  \nand procedures, and displaying outstanding Guest service.  \n \nAs managers, you have to realize how important our role is. The  Guest experience is \ndirectly impacted by how we organize our crew and utilize our time and the team\u2019s time.  \n \nEnforcing Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Standards   \n \nIn addition to exemplifying the model Team Member, managers will also take an active \nrole in enforcing  Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  as they apply to food quality, \ncleanliness, employee hygiene, uniforms, and service. The following must be consistently \nenforced each and every shift.  \n \n1. Quality of food  \u2013 Only the freshest, hottest product must be served to the Guest. \nInsure that quality line checks are getting done before each shift. Take this time to \nguarantee all products meet our standards. They need to meet the FAT test. \nF=Flavor A=Appearance T=Temperature . If we are 100% in compliance with the \nFAT profi le we will exceed what the Guest expects.   \n2. Hygiene \u2013Team Members must be neatly groomed each and every time they come to \nwork.  Baths, deodorants, mouthwashes, and colognes are all known to be protective \nmeasures.  Hair must be cleaned and neatly combed; long hair must be restrained. \nArrive to work in 100% proper uniform.  \n3. Uniforms \u2013Team Members must be instructed as to the designated uniform to be \nworn in the restaurant.  The Cheeseburger  Bobby\u2019s  uniform  includes: black, non -slip \nsoled shoes (no sneakers), black belt, and pressed black pants, pressed Cheeseburger \nBobby\u2019s shirt , name tag  and Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s hat.  This uniform must be worn \nat all times and with all of the accessories issued. The most i mportant part of your \nuniform is a sincere SMILE ! A smile is such a critical part of our uniform. A great \nSmile radiates a contagious feeling to your fellow Team Members and our Guest.  \n4. Service \u2013 The distinguishing feature of Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s is our ou tstanding \nGuest service.  As a result, managers must make Guest service their number one \npriority.  You only get one chance to make a first impression with our Guest. We \nmust WOW our Guests with awesome service and great food.  \n5. Sanitation - Our Guests like to know they are eating in a clean, sanitized and well run \nbusiness. Every Team Member must be very conscious of sanitation, using gloves \nwhen required and washing their hands often. Keeping your Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nclean is everyone on t he TEAMS job.  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s basic operating principles are the heart to our success. Each of \nthese principles is basic and simple to execute. Each must become standard behaviour in  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 99 \n \nthe execution of running shifts. It must be clear to all managers that being active with \nGuests and Team Members during hours of Operation is a standard requirement. Between \nthe hours of 11a.m. -2 p.m. and between the hours of 5p.m. -9p.m. a manager or Key team \nmember must be out front on the floor. If you must leave for a ny reason communicate to \nthe shift leader.  \n \nThe Home Base Principle : This is a simple principle that leads to great execution.  \n \nWhen running a shift one of the key locations for the manager  to always be keyed into is \nthe make table. From there 100% of the  food quality and most of the service and \ncleanliness standards can be managed identified and rectified by the manager or by \ngiving direction to a team member. When working your 8 steps always return to HOME \nBASE.  \n \nGetting out from behind the line must tak e place about every 20 minutes.  \nAdditionally, as the manager walks the dining room he/she must also be quickly checking \nthe restrooms for cleanliness and stocking issues. Walk the back of the house to follow up \non the prep, dish and storage procedures.  \n \nLittle time must be spent in the office. Our business is so simplistic that during open \nhours the manager must not be in the office at all. It is imperative to the success of the \nbusiness to focus on what is inside the 4 walls in the front of the house. Wh en leaving \nHome Base always manage these 2 important action plans:  \n \n1. Praise the appropriate behaviors; this promotes more of the same.  \n \n2. Coach to the standard, if you do not address substandard work quality you in essence \nmake a new standard. When you don\u2019t address inappropriate work behavior the Team \nMember thinks that you don\u2019t really know the standard yourself and lose respect for \nyou as well.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 100 \n \nRunning a Quality Shift: Managing the 8\u2019s  \n \nBelow are the Managers Figure 8\u2019s items.

This is your last opportunity to impress the customer.  \nLet your guest know that you are excited they chose Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s.  \n \nFour Ways to Impress Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Guest.  \n \n1.

Never say you don\u2019t like a particular product.  Say, \u201cMany of our Guest\u2019s love that \nbut my favorite is\u2026\u201d  \n3. Thank Guests for all compliments whether they are directed at you, the restaurant, or \nsomeone else.  \n4. Don\u2019t let one unhappy or unappreciative Guest affect the service to another.  If a \nGuest has a pro blem, correct it as tactfully and graciously as possible and move on to \nthe next Guest.  \n5. Speak well of your restaurant\u2019s food, service, management, and team members both \ninside and outside the restaurant.  \n6. Never say no to a Guest request, even though it may sound outrageous, e ither do it or \noffer an alternative . \n \nHelpful Management Tips  \n \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the parking lot. When you see numerous cars pull in you can \nassume that you will need burger patties. Get them on the grill. It will take them \nabout 1 -2 minutes to get in the door, 1 -2 minutes to place their order, get cups, \nand pay. By the time they get to their table their order must almost be completed.  \n\uf0b7 You must have the appropriate par levels of baskets to get through a busy shift \nwithout having to was h any. This situation gives you the ability to focus on \nturning tables and taking care of the guest rather than constantly monitoring \nequipment amounts during peak volume.  \n\uf0b7 Cross -utilize your staff effectively. If you need more tables cleaned pull team \nmem bers from other areas to assist getting tables cleaned. Remember the more  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 104 \n \npositions your team members can perform the more efficient and flexible your \nrestaurant can be run. Imagine a work force where everyone can perform in every \nposition. You then have f lexibility, numerous trainers and the power to discipline \nyour team when needed without the fear of that member walking out leaving you \nhigh and dry.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your OMC checklists are completed. The best way to prepare for a \nshift is to be set up.  \n\uf0b7 Be cert ain you have plenty of change in the till. Taking time in the middle of a \nbusy shift is not good. You have numerous other responsibilities you have to be \nlooking after.  \n \nThe HOW\u2019s  \n \nRemember your restaurants success depends on the HOW\u2019S  \nHOW fresh are your  products?  \nHOW clean is your restaurant?  \nHOW great is the service?  \n \nAt $3000 worth of sales that equals about 400 guests dining at Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s a \nday. That is 400+ people talking about HOW great or HOW bad a dining experience they \nhad.  \n \nThat\u2019s a lot of word of mouth floating around a community.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 105 \n \nLabor Scheduling  \n \nThe Work Schedule is a most valuable tool available to you.  If it is used properly, your \nrestaurant will run well, stay clean and maintain controls.  The schedule is your overall \nplan for each day, week and month.  Labor hours are both an expense and a resource.  By \nhaving the right people working at the right time you maximize sales and deliver the best \ncustomer experience while staying on budget.  \n \nThere are several tools that you need to build a Work Schedule:  \n \n\uf0b7 Availability Worksheet:  this is your list of employees with the days and hours \nthey are available and the lists the positions they can work.  \n\uf0b7 Hourly Sales Guide:  projecting sales is the foundation of making a sched ule.  The \nHourly Sales Guide provides the historical sales to help you project the current \nweek\u2019s sales.  \n\uf0b7 Promotion Schedule/Calendar:  planning for coupons drops, product promotions, \nand school nights allows you to have the staff on hand for potential sale s increases \nper day and per shift.  \n\uf0b7 Labor Productivity Chart:  this chart gives you the information to determine the \nnumber of staff needed per sales hour taking into account the experience of your \nstaff.  \n \nBefore you start to make out a schedule, be sure yo u have the tools you need have been \nupdated with current information:  \n \n \u2022     The most recent Hourly Sales Guide  \n \u2022     Employee Availability Form  \n \u2022     Employee requests for days off  \n\u2022 Promotion schedule  \n\u2022 Last week's Work Schedule  \n \nBe sure you choose a quiet place to do the schedule where you will not be interrupted.  \nGive yourself at least 1 to 2 hours to complete it.  Before starting review the following:  \n \n1.  Sales Projections are the most important part of scheduling since they provide \nthe basis for all other computations.  \na. Use Hourly Sales Guide to compute the average of last 2 -3 similar \nweeks  \nb. Adjust for promotions or LSM efforts.  \nc. Revise for local events such as parades, concerts, or ball games.  Look \nat the Hourly Sales  Guide for previous year sales on the event dates.   \nd. Review previous week's schedule for observations that apply to current \nweek.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 106 \n \n2.  Do Sales projections by hour for each day of the week.  \n \n3.  Determine number of people needed per hour.  \n \nOnce you have  determined the hour's sales, determine the number of \npeople needed using the Labor Productivity Chart.  Consider which part of \nthe hour has the most sales to determine if people should be brought in on \nthe 1/2 hour.  Consider your team's experience level and position \nknowledge when scheduling.  \n \n4.  Schedule Management shifts.  \n \nMake sure a Management person (including Shift Manager) is responsible \nfor each shift. Keep the Management overlap to as little as possible.  The \nmanager should always be in the rest aurant during the busiest times and \nshould work some weekends and nights.  Schedule time for management \nresponsibilities.  \n \n5.  Add hours for all additional jobs.   \n a. Opening  \n b. Set -up prep       \nc. Closing     \n d. Orientation/Training  \n \n6.  Add hours for special events and LSM activities.  \n  \n7.  Double check that you are within the labor standard for the week.  \n \nCalculate the hours you project to use based on the projected sales \nvolume.  Look carefully over your projections and your numbers of people \nto catc h any weak spots or errors.  \n \nThe minimum coverage for lunch is four people between 11:30 am and 2 \npm and three people at minimum during all other hours of operation.  It is \nhighly recommended to have four people on staff from 5 pm to 8:30 pm.  \n \n8.  Invest a dditional hours to build the business.  \n a. Lunch  \n b. Dinner  \n \nIf you have scheduled to beat the standard for the week, look for places to invest \nadditional hours to build the business.   \n \n9.  Write in names.   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 107 \n \n  \nWhen figuring your team's placement on the sche dule, consider \npersonalities that work together well.  Also schedule your inexperienced \nstaff with the more experienced.   Once the names and positions are filled \nin, schedule a break for each person working over a 5 hour shift; make \nsure the area is cover ed.  Always make time for training and cross \ntraining. If you have staff that worked a fixed weekly schedule, put them \non the schedule first.  \n \n10.  Schedule breaks.  \n \nAlways schedule breaks along non -peak hours.  Block that person off the \nschedule and make  sure they're covered.  \n \n11.  Review training needs/goals and revise shifts as needed to have experts \nworking when training will take place.  \n \nSchedule trainees with strong employees that can pick up the slack for a \nnew person.  The restaurant manager should  always work with new people \non their first day.  \n \n12.  Post by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.  \n \nThe schedule is a management tool.  If sales are consistently down, you will need to \nadjust the rest of the week's sales in addition to the labor and product needs.  Nev er wait \nuntil Sunday to adjust for the week's low sales.  Let the schedule help you by marking \nspecial situations.  Also, mark on the schedule communications or motivations; you'll be \nsurprised how many of your staff will read it.  \n \nAvailability Worksheet  \nThe Availability Worksheet is used as a reference for scheduling and hiring needs.  It is a \nrecord for when employees are available to work throughout the week as well as in what \npositions they are proficient.  \n \nHow to use:  \n  \n 1.  List employee name and pho ne number under the appropriate day/part.  \n 2.  Mark the days of the week the employee can work.  \n 3.  Rank the positions in which the employee can work.  \n 4.  Keep this chart with you when completing the schedule.  \n 5.  Write in employee's age if under 18.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 108 \n \nThe Availability Worksheet can be an invaluable tool for scheduling and covering \npositions during sickness or employee shortages.  \n \n \nManager Schedule  \n \nPrepare a monthly manager schedule and post it the week before the preceding month.  \nThe manager schedule must take into account management responsibilities and upcoming \nevents including:  Local Store Marketing, holidays, days off and meetings.  Completing a \nmonthly schedule for managers allows them to better balance their work and personal \nlives.  It insures that critical manager tasks are planned for and completed on time.  The \nmanager should work mostly mid shifts, working lunch through the busiest part of dinner.  \nThe assistant manager should work the busy day parts with open or close shifts.  The \nassistant  manager covers the mid shifts when the manager is not working.  Crew leaders \ncover the less busy closing and opening shifts.  \n \n \nShift Position Chart  \nThe shift position chart is a tool designed to be used by the manager on duty. The purpose \nof the chart is to ensure the manager on duty is positioning employees according to \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s deployment standards. Additionally, each position should be filled \nby a well -trained employee, ensuring we have our \u201caces in their places.\u201d Proper staffing, \ntraining, scheduling and positioning are all key components to be rush -ready and provide \nevery customer a great Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s experience.  \n \nThe shift position chart should be laminated and posted in area of the store visible to team \nmembers and out of view to customers. The manager on duty is responsible for filling in \nthe blanks before opening for lunch and after shift change for dinner. (Tip: Use a dry \nerase marker for easy marking and clean -up) \n \nThe shift position chart was designed to work in sync with the Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nlabor scheduling tools.  \n \nIn order for the position chart to be an effective tool for the manager on duty, the back -up \nwork must be done to ensure accurate schedules are created by using accurate and current \nsales.  \n \nAnytime the manager  assumes responsibility for a shift, one of the key responsibilities is \nto verify staff coverage for the shift. The first step is to review the schedule to be sure no \none will be running late to work, manager simply fills in the laminated position chart.  \n \nBy making the position chart part of the manager\u2019s daily routine, it forces them to \nconsider his or her team, and to place team members in positions that will ensure the best \nexperience for Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s customers. Additionally, fellow employees wil l  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 109 \n \ngrow accustomed to checking the chart as soon as they clock -in to begin work \nimmediately. By highlighting shift priorities and other team member\u2019s shifts, everyone \nwill be aware of in and out times and how they can support one another to make it a \nproduc tive workday.  Having the shift huddle for each shift in front of the position chart \nwill reinforce the manager\u2019s communication.  \n \nLabor Productivity Chart  \n \nIn order to figure the number of staff required per sales hours, you need the Labor \nProductivity Chart.  The chart gives you the information to layout.  \n \nOpening and Closing Labor Hours  \n \nOpening and closing hours are determined by the size of the restaurant, sales volume and \npre-closing hourly sales.  The size of the restaurant impacts closing hours, t he bigger the \ndining room/kitchen area the longer it can take to close.  Another impact on closing hours \nis the sales volume of the hours just before close.  Higher sales volumes make reduce the \namount of pre -closing that can be done, therefore increasing work to be done at close.  \nLastly sales volume impacts the morning prep need to get the restaurant ready to open.   \n \nAs a starting point, it is recommended to schedule 4 to 5 hours for opening and 4 hours \nfor closing.  The 5 hours for opening includes:  \n1. Two employees arrive at 9 a.m.  \n2. The third employee arrives at 10 a.m.  This should be the restaurant manager \nor shift leader.  \n3. The opening checklist is completed with the restaurant ready to open at 10:45 \na.m.  \n \nThe 4 hours for closing includes:  \n1. Three closers a nd the shift leader/manager comprise the closing crew.   \n2. The closers are assigned to each of the closing zones:  dining room, service \narea, grill area, and kitchen.   \n3. Each closer completes their zone checklist and helps others complete closing \ntheir areas.    \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 110 \n \n \n \nPosition Validation: Dish/Prep        \n \nInitial to indicate you have demonstrated competence in following areas:  \n \n \nMIT  \n \n____  Read the primary and secondary duties and follows proper practices  \n____  Adheres to critical success factors   \n____  Read the 3S\u2019s section of the Operations Manual  \n____  Demonstrated knowledge of the following Dish duties  \no 3 compartment sink standards with proper chemical levels  \no Sanitation usage of sanitizer buckets  \no Back of the house FIFO of dry storage  \no Walk -in cooler organized to  health department code  \no Security of back door locked at all times  \no Assist service Team Member  \no Completion of prep sheet/prepping of product to recipe adherence  \n____  Properly used cutlery and cutting boards  \n \n \n___________________________   _____________________ _________  \nManager -In-Training     Certified Trainer   Date  \n \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 -

Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s was born of Bob and Richard\u2019s passion for \ngiving their Guests the freshest, best -tasting food, great service and outstanding value  in \na place they\u2019re proud to bring their families.  \n \nThe first Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s opened in Hiram, G eorgia in August, 2007 and became \nan overnight success. Guests couldn\u2019t get enough of our gourmet, hand -pattied burgers. \nWe grill them to perfection and Guests top them any way they like at Bobby\u2019s \u201cBuild \nYour Own Burger Bar.\u201d Guests also love our fresh Fr ench fries, which we slice twice \ndaily in our kitchen, our sizzling hotdogs and tasty chicken, and our old -fashioned \nCustard desserts.  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s burger was voted the Best Hamburger in Hiram in 2008, and \nsuddenly it seemed as if every town want ed its own Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Restaurant. \nThe formula for success caught on, and Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s was soon opening \ncorporate stores and franchised units.  \n \nRichard and Bob have extensive restaurant experience, a knack for carving a niche in the \n\u201cQuic k Casual\u201d dining segment and a shared passion for excellence. Having hands -on \nexperience in both full service and fast food operations gives the brothers a keen insight \ninto what the Guest desires.  \n \n\u201cThe consumer wants a fresh product with a great price point,\u201d says Bob Stoll. \u201cWe give \nthe Guest a great product with added touches of full service without having to pay the \nadditional cost of a gratuity.

These factors will be detailed \nwithin each j ob description. Execution and knowledge of the critical success factors ensures that \nour Team Members will deliver a great product to our Guests.  \n \n   \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  6 \n \nGrill Cook Position  \n \nGrill Cook Primary Responsibilities:  \n\uf0b7 Stock area for lunch and dinner shifts.  \n\uf0b7 Rotate product to ensure FIFO (First In/First Out).  \n\uf0b7 Make sure all equipment is working and is at the required temperature s. \n\uf0b7 Complete checklist.  \n\uf0b7 Place burgers, chicken, hot dogs, and veggie burgers on grill in timely manner.  \n\uf0b7 Ensure proper amount of seasoning is placed on proper items.  \n\uf0b7 Be sure work area is cleaned and sanitized throughout the shift.  \n\uf0b7 Keep the grill  consistently clean of build up.  \n\uf0b7 Follow \u201cService Steps\u201d  \n \n \nGrill Cook Secondary Responsibilities:  \n\uf0b7 Stage baskets with liners.  \n\uf0b7 Restock  grill items.  \n\uf0b7 Change s anitizer buckets as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Welcome our Guests with tag Team Greet  \n \n \nGrill Maintenance  \n \nDuring the shift the grill must be constantly maintained. There must never be a dark build up on \nthe grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nEvery week use the flat to p thermometer to calibrate the temperature of the flat tops. This \nprocess will ensure the flat top is cooking even throughout the grill.  \n \nTurn the grill on at 9:00 AM to get ready to begin the day\u2019s cooking process.  \n \n \nGrill Calibration:  Thermostat Adjustment Procedure  \n \nEach week the grill surface temperature is to be checked to insure that the grill temperatures are \ncorrect.  Initially the temperature was adjusted at the factory. However, if the grill surface \ntemperature varies greatly from the sett ing on the thermostat knob adjust the thermostat using the \nfollowing procedure:  \n \n1. Turn all the control knobs to the 350\u00b0F setting.  \n2. Wait 30 minutes (or 1 hour if grill was cold) for surface to stabilize.  \n3. Place a thermocouple with surface temperature probe ha lfway back from the front to the \nback of the grill plate and directly over a burner set (in line with a burner control knob).  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  7 \n \nCheck the temperature over each burner set every 5 minutes until the temperature over \neach burner set stabilizes and does not chan ge by more than 30\u00b0F between two \nconsecutive measurements.  \n4. If the average temperature over any burner set is not within 30\u00b0F of the knob setting \n(350\u00b0F), adjust the corresponding thermostat by removing the knob, holding the \nthermostat stem (do not allow st em to turn or temperature setting will be changed) and \nturning the small screw located within the base of the stem. Turn this screw counter \nclockwise to increase the temperature, clockwise to decrease the temperature.  \n \n \nGrill Cooler  \n \nIt is the responsibili ty of the cook to maintain the proper ingredient inventory in the grill \ndrawers. The grill cook must constantly be aware of the temperature of products in the grill \ndrawers. Refrigerated products require a temperature of 40 degrees F or less to assure a \ntemperature that does not promote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nMaintain a minimum of a two hour inventory of product in the grill cooler to include:  \n\uf0b7 4.7 ounce hamburger portions  \n\uf0b7 Chicken breasts  \n\uf0b7 6 to 1 and 8 to 1 Hot dogs  \n\uf0b7 Turkey patties  \n\uf0b7 Veggie patties  \n\uf0b7 American, cheddar, Swiss, Bleu, and shredded cheddar cheese  \n\uf0b7 Saut\u00e9ed onions  \n \nTwice a day check the temperature of product in the grill drawers to insure products are \nmaintained between 34 and 40 degrees.  Temperature checks are  made at 10 am and 4 pm.  \nRefrigerated products require a temperature of 40\u00b0 F or less to assure a temperature that does not \npromote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nBreak Down of the Grill Cooler  \n \n\uf0b7 At closing each night, the ent ire grill cooler and bun flat tops area must be thoroughly \ncleaned and sanitized. Use the current grill cleaning method to ensure the best result.  \n\uf0b7 Pull out all products and wrap with plastic wrap.  Make sure to date each item.  \n\uf0b7 Manager must be notified of a ny item which appears to be of inferior quality or is out of \nshelf life.  Items can only be discarded with manager\u2019s permission.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  8 \n \n \nMeat Grill Setup  \n \nIt will take 15 minutes for the grill to warm up to the correct temperature. Season the grill with \noil from the fryer before cooking.  The temperature of the burger and bun grills is set to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Burger grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n\uf0b7 Bun grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n \nSmall equ ipment required:  \n\uf0b7 One meat spatula  \n\uf0b7 One poultry spatula  \n\uf0b7 Grill scraper  \n\uf0b7 Grill squeegee/scraper  \n\uf0b7 One spatula for veggie burger/grilled cheese  \n\uf0b7 Red, yellow and black tongs  \n\uf0b7 Digital thermometer  \n\uf0b7 Six dome lids  \n \nOther items required:  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with water  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with liquid margarine  \n\uf0b7 Burger seasoning in stainless shaker  \n\uf0b7 Small bucket with a clean towel and sanitizer solution  \n\uf0b7 Roller and with liquid margarine for buns  \n \nDuring the shift the grill is cleaned and maintained to minimize build -up of carbon on the \nsurface. There must never be a dark build up on the grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nGrease tub :   The grease tub is designed to contain grease run off from the grill surface. The \ngrease tub must never be allowed to overfill.  Empty the grease tub tw ice daily and dispose of the \ngrease properly.  \n \n \nBurger Cooking Procedure  \n \nProper cooking and seasoning of burgers is paramount to making a great burger.  Always place \nthe burger at the beginning of the grill that is designated for the first stage of the co oking \nprocess.  Placement of the burgers is important in maximizing the space on the grill and tracking \nthe cooking process.  All burgers are cooked to medium well.  On request burgers can be cooked \nto well done only.  Burgers cannot be cooked less than me dium well.  \n.   \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  9 \n \n1. Using the meat tongs, place the burger meat on the grill three burgers\u2019 distance (14 \ninches) from the side of the grill.  The side of the grill is determined by the product flow \nto the expo station.  \n2. Press burger using steak weight into a 5 in ch patty.  \n3. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  Move burger using spatula.  \n4. Cook for 2 minutes 30 seconds and flip the burger.  \n5. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  \n6. Check burger doneness in 2 minutes 30 seconds.  To check that the hamburgers are \ncooked throughout, place a small nick in the center of the burger. If the juice comes out \nclear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be cooked a little more.  The internal temperature \nmust reach at least 160\u00b0 to 165\u00b0 F.  \n7. Dredge burg er through accumulated burger fat on the grill.  \n8. Put cheese on burgers immediately if requested and cover with dome.  Pull burgers \nwithout cheese off the grill.  \n9. Allow cheese to partially melt (10 to 15 seconds) and remove burger from grill.  \nAmerican cheese  takes 10 seconds and the other cheeses take 15 seconds.  \n \nCritical Success Factors  \n \n\uf0b7 Use the burger seasoning mix on both sides of the burger.  \n\uf0b7 Do not over season product (use correct seasoning distribution container).  \n\uf0b7 Do not allow the cheese to over melt.  \n\uf0b7 To check that the hamburgers are cooked throughout, place a small nick in the center \nof the burger. If the juice comes out clear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be \ncooked a little more. The temperature must be 160 to 165 degrees.  \n\uf0b7 It is important to properly forecast the flow of burgers to be placed on the grill based \nupon:  \n1. The flow of Guest coming through the door.   \n2. The number of take -out tickets.  \n3. The number of Guest tickets spooling out of the printer.  \n \n \nVeggie Burgers  \n \nProcess:  \n\uf0b7 Squirt water on  the grill where you will be putting the veggie burger.  \n\uf0b7 Using tongs, place the veggie burger on the grill that is assigned for the veggie \nburger. It is the one that the buns are cooked on.  \n\uf0b7 Place the cooking dome over the top of the veggie burger.  \n\uf0b7 Cook fo r 2 \u00bd minutes on one side.  \n\uf0b7 Flip, replace the dome and cook for an additional 2 \u00bd minutes.  \n\uf0b7 Top with any requested toppings.  \n  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  10 \n \n \nCritical Success Factors  \n\uf0b7 Use the small spatulas for the veggie burger. Other spatulas must not be used. You do \nnot want to cross -contaminate your food products from one to the next.  \n \n \nChicken (Cooking)  \n \nProcess:  \n\uf0b7 Squirt butter on the grill designated for the chicken.  \n\uf0b7 Place fully thawed chicken with tongs, rib side up on the grill.  \n\uf0b7 Lightly sprinkle with burger seasoning  \n\uf0b7 Cover with cooking dome and cook for 3 minutes.  \n\uf0b7 Remove dome, turn product over with designated spatula.  \n\uf0b7 Squirt water on grill beside chicken, replace dome and cook for 2 \u00bd minutes.  \n\uf0b7 Chicken is done when it reaches 165 to 170 degrees F.  \n\uf0b7 Top with cheese if requested and  melt, must have a nice shine to it but not running off \nthe product.  \n \nCritical Success Factors  \n \n\uf0b7 Make sure that the chicken breast is fully thawed.  \n\uf0b7 Always place the chicken breast on the chicken designated part of the grill using the \npoultry tongs. Make sur e to use the spatula that is only used on the chicken so that you \nwill not cross -contaminate from one product to the other.  \n\uf0b7 Use the spec seasoning mix.  \n\uf0b7 Do not press the product.

We will never put our Guest \nat risk by cooking a burger any other way.  \n \n\uf0b7 Another key to cooking a great Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s burger is to add the quarter \nteaspoon of seasoning on the burger  at just the right time.

Word of mouth is our life blood to success. We want our \nTeam Members and Guest to know we have the highest of standards in regards to the 3 \nS\u2019s  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  42 \n \nSanitation  \n \nThe primary goal of a food service sanitation program is to protect the Guest from food -\nborne illness. This task is not easy, but it can be done. The most effective method is a \nthree -staged attack:  \n \n1. Protect food against contamination between the temperatures 41\u00b0 -140\u00b0, the danger \nzone.  \n2. Reduce the effect of contamination that does occur.  \n3. Ensure all Team Members are well versed in sanitation procedures.  \n \nThe definition of sanitized is the reduction of h armful bacteria to a safe level.  \n \nTwo common causes of food borne illness:  \n1. Cross Contamination.                                    \n2. Food remaining in the danger zone too long.  \n \nTwo ways to avoid cross -contamination:  \n1. Ensure proper hand washing with soap and hot water for 20 seconds and rinse.  \n2. Use proper color coded cutting boards and use proper utensils.  \n \nFood contamination may occur from any of three hazards:  \n \n1. Biological  - Bacterial contamination. This is controlled by practicing safe food \nhandling and stora ge procedures.  \n2. Chemical  - Contamination of foods with pesticides, use of excessive additives, and \ncontamination of food with toxic metals. Proper storage of chemicals and equipment \nand use of proper storage containers control this.  \n3. Physical  - Contamination  of foods with broken glass, metal fragments, etc. This can \nbe controlled by good facilities maintenance, planning, and training Team Members \nin safe operating procedures.  \n \nFood Poisoning  \n \nThe fear of food poisoning is always present in every restaurant.  Years of effort in \nbuilding a great food service reputation can be destroyed, virtually overnight, if an \noutbreak occurs in an establishment.  Food poisoning occurs in two ways:  \n \n1. A food -borne infection (disease which occurs from eating food which contains  a \nharmful micro -organism)  \n2. A food -borne intoxication (when poisons or toxins in the food cause illness in the \nbody.)  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  43 \n \nFood Handling  \n \nIt is of the utmost importance that food is handled with the greatest care to prevent the \nspread of any bacteria that may cause food poisoning.  \n \nBacterial reaction creates what is called a TOXIN.  Toxins that are produced by bacteria \nare poisonous in the finished cooked product.  Sometimes, although we think that we \nhave taken adequate care of our products; bacterial acti ons in these products are such that \nthe toxins produced will remain poisonous.  \n \nWatchwords in the food service industry are KEEP IT HOT, OR KEEP IT COLD, or \nDON\u2019T USE IT.  All products must remain heated or refrigerated to maintain a product \ntemperature wi thin the food safeness range: Do not hold at room temperature!  \n \nRefrigerate to: 40\u00b0 F or below  \nHeat to: 140\u00b0 F or above  \n \nPotential Food Safeness Problem Areas in a Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s:  \nThe manager must inform Team Members to notify him/her if any of the f ollowing \nprocedures have occurred:  \n \n1. Containers of prepared foods not labeled with date and time.  \n2. Canned products that are swollen.  \n3. Any bone chips in the burgers.  \n4. Chicken that is not rotated and has a foul odor.  \n5. A foul odor when a can is opened or if the p roduct appears to be unusually thinned.  \nDO NOT TASTE THE PRODUCT. It is probably unsafe. Contaminated food could \ncause you to become extremely ill.  \n6. Have sanitizer buckets at all appropriate stations. Buckets must be changed every half \nhour or as needed.  \n7. Product left in opened can and put back in the cooler. No canned product must ever \nbe stored in the original container once it has been opened.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  44 \n \nWalk -In Cooler  \n \nFungus, mold, or spoilage may occur on the outside surface of some items in the walk -in \ncooler.  In the walk -in cooler, warm air rises and condensation falls.  All bacterial growth \nrequires warmth and moisture.  When the door of the cooler is opened warm a ir from the \noutside rushes into the cooler.  This causes condensation on the food products stored on \nthe lower shelves or floor.  The moisture contacting the meat or produce can cause a \nslimy surface. Temperature of the cooler and cold units must be 40\u00b0 or  less.  \n \n1. Items stored on lower shelves of the walk -in cooler must be products that cannot be \ncontaminated through condensation.   \n2. The middle shelves have the greatest air circulation.  \n3. The top shelves must be used to store perishable items such as lettuce,  tomatoes, and \nother perishables that require a colder temperature.  \n4. Follow food hierarchy with all products in cooler.  \n \nNo matter how well the refrigeration unit is cleaned and sanitized, if fungus or mold \nspores contaminate the refrigeration unit, they ca n reproduce and contaminate the entire \ncooler area.  Although the cooler may be clean one day, if the fan, drip pan, and \nrefrigeration unit are not cleaned as well, the entire cooler area can be re -contaminated.  \nTherefore, when the walk -in units are clean ed, also clean the pans, the fan blades, the \nunits themselves, and the top of the refrigeration units . \n \nGrill Table Sanitation  \n \n1. All products must be stored in proper containers to prevent meat juices from dripping \ninto the other product.  \n2. The drawers must remain closed when not in use.  \n3. The internal temperature of the product in the grill table cooler inserts must be \nchecked periodically during the day using a probe thermometer to ensure all \ningredients are refrigerated to 40\u00ba F or below.   \n4. Product should nev er be left in the grill coolers overnight. All products should be \nremoved and taken to the walk -in cooler for storage.  \n5. To avoid cross contamination the cook must never handle raw meat and then touch \nthe cheese going on top of the burger.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  45 \n \nStorage  \n \nAll stoc k must be stored in the designated storage areas immediately after it has been \ndated and rotated.  Dry groceries, canned goods, and paper products must be placed in \ndry storage.  Perishable foods must be refrigerated or frozen immediately.  \n \nStorage and Rot ation  \n \n1. Label all products immediately upon delivery to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) \nrotation procedures are followed.  \n2. All perishable foods must be refrigerated immediately upon delivery.  \n3. To ensure a food safe product temperature, equip all refrigeration units with \nthermometers and check at each shift change.   \nWalk -in cooler, salad bar and coolers:  36 - 40\u00b0 F  \nFreezers: 0 -10\u00b0 F  \n4. Properly store food items in the walk -in cooler and freezer to minimize \ncontamination.  To prevent spoilage and to ensure proper rotation, do not place new \nproduct directly on top of the previously thawed products.  \n5. Know and follow all shelf life guidelines.  Any product that is not used before its \nexpiration date must  be discarded.  \n6. Do not store containers directly on the floor.  Items must be stored at least 6\u201d off the \nfloor for sanitation purposes.  Check with your local Health Department for \nrequirements.  \n7. In storing foods, permit free circulation of cool air on all s urfaces.  \n8. Check all food items daily for spoilage.  \n \nDry Storage  \n \n1. Dry storage items must be kept in a cool, dry (70 -80\u00b0 F) area to prevent spoilage and \nswelling of canned goods.  \n2. Dry storage areas must be kept clean and free of rodents and insects.  This means that \nall walls, ceilings, and floor openings must be sealed or otherwise protected.  \n3. All products must be arranged to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) rotation \nprocedures are followed.  Arrangement of shelves must be in accordance with that of \nthe inventory worksheet.  \n \nFood Handling Guidelines  \n \nThe best way to control the spread of bacteria is:  \n \n1. Cleanliness of food handlers - Hand washing -Glove usage  \n2. Proper sanitation in the kitchen.  \n3. Minimize exposure of opened or prepared foods to room temperatu re. \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  46 \n \n \nTeam Member Sanitation Guidelines  \n \n1. Practice good personal hygiene habits. WASH HANDS with soap and water for a \nminimum of 20 seconds  before and after handling food, going to  the restroom, using \ncleaning or other chemicals, smoking, handling money, handling raw meats, coughing \nor sneezing, picking up items off the floor, touching your hair, face, or other parts of \nyour body.  Restrooms must have a sign posted reminding Team Members to wash \ntheir hands.  \n2. Never let food come in contact with sores or cuts. Team Members must use proper \ncolored bandages and finger cots.  \n3. Properly refrigerate food to 40\u00b0 F or below; thoroughly heat or cook food to 140\u00b0 F or \nabove to ensure food remains within the food safeness range.  \n4. Prepare only one day\u2019s anticipated usag e of any food item according to the Manager \u2019s \nPreparation List.  \n5. DO NOT add raw ingredients to foods that receive no further cooking.  \n6. DO NOT cross -contaminate different types of foods. This usually happens through \nmishandling or misuse of common cooking ut ensils or equipment.  \n7. DO NOT refreeze any product, which has previously thawed.  \n8. All food contact surfaces must be cleaned after every use with a clean, hot towel and \nan approved sanitized rinse (such as bleach/water solution).  \n9. Wear proper hair restraints to  meet Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s  standards  and Health \nDepartment regulations to prevent contaminating food with hair.  \n10. Investigate suspected contamination for determination of food safeness: suspect \nproducts must be discarded.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  47 \n \nKeys To Prevent Guests Getting Food -Borne Illness:  \n \n\uf0b7 Use sanitizer to clean all areas. Towels must be in hand or sanitizer bucket.  \n\uf0b7 Rotate sanitizer buckets a minimum of every 30 minutes or as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Keep raw and cooked food out of danger zone at all times.  \n\uf0b7 Team Members consistently wash  their hands for at least 20 seconds.  \n\uf0b7 Check product temperatures every hour on the hour.  \n\uf0b7 Thoroughly complete  Open -Mid-Close checklists.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all OMC checklists for documentation purposes.  \n\uf0b7 Constantly changing out gloves.  \n\uf0b7 While running the 8 steps look to en sure compliance of food handling.  \n\uf0b7 Aprons are changed as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your thermometer is calibrated.  \n\uf0b7 Use tongs to handle chicken.  \n\uf0b7 Use proper color cutting boards  \n\uf0b7 With any Guest issues follow risk management procedures 100% and inform the \nunits GM.  \n\uf0b7 When inspections are done by health department shadow the inspector and make \nimmediate impact on any violations. SHOW A SENSE OF URGENY.  \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  48 \n \nJOB SAFETY  \n \nThe goal of every safety and health program is to provide a safe workplace and to \nprevent:  \n1. Accidents.  \n2. Injury.  \n3. Job-related illness.  \n \nManagers want to prevent accidents realizing that accident prevention and efficient \nproduction go together.  Managers must take the necessary steps to ensure that their \nTeam Members have a safe place to work and that they foll ow work safety procedures.  \n \nMajor concerns in accident prevention are:  \n \n1. Making the workplace as safe as possible.  \n2. Controlling Team Member action.  \n \nMost accidents are caused by inappropriate behavior on the part of the Team Member, \nrather than uncontrollable physical conditions.  Accidents  usually occur because a Team \nMember acted improperly or was in violation of Company safety rules or its policies.  \n \nTo make Team Members truly safety -conscious, the manager must:  \n \n1. Make Team Members aware  of safety.  \n2. Reinforce the concept in face -to-face relationships with Team Members.  \n \nSafety responsibilities of management:  \n \n1. Develop, maintain, teach, and enforce safety  procedures consistently every day.  \n2. Identification of possible hazardous areas.  \n3. Keeping the workplace and machinery in safe condition.  \n4. Establishing and enforcing safe work methods for Team Members.  \n5. Instructing Team Members in safe job performance.  \n6. Follow -up to ensure Team Members continue to meet safety requirements.  \n7. Providing a good example of safe working habits.  \n8. Understanding in dealing with Team Members who are unresponsive to safety \npractices.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  49 \n \nTo minimize the adverse effects of accidents and prevent their recurrence you must:  \n \n1. Maintain all required first aid items in first aid kit . \n2. Display emergency procedures  including emergency phone numbers for police, \nparamedics and fire departments.  \n3. Train Team Members to:  \na. Follow emergency procedures.  \nb. Prom ptly report every accident.  \n4. Gather, analyze, and report information regarding an accident.  \n5. Take action  on the results of an accident investigation to prevent recurrence  of a \nsimilar accident.  \n6. Maintain a working environment that has no safety or health haza rds. \n7. Communicate  with employees in a manner that minimizes episodes of highly \nemotional behavior that often results in accidents.  \n \nEach manager must establish additional Team Member safety training .  Films are \navailable from your local fire department.  \n \nCostly Injuries:  \n \nThe primary accidents within our industry are:  \n \n1. Injuries that occur due to improper lifting procedures.  These injuries are normally the \nMOST COSTLY in work -time loss, medical treatment and claims.  \n2. Injuries due to a slip or fall on a wet floor.  \n3. Injuries by cuts, i.e., punctures, scrapes, lacerations.  \n4. Injuries by burns due to scalding or heat/cold exposure.  \n \nThese accidents result in:  \n \n1. Time lost by injured Team Member.  \n2. Lost time by fellow Team Members who stop to aid an injured co -worker or  those \nwho stop out of curiosity.  \n3. Lost production.  \n4. Spoilage or damage to inventory.  \n5. Property damage.  \n6. Hiring and training of a replacement Team Member.  \n7. Resulting loss of business.  \n8. Valuable time spent by company Management investigating cause of accident.  \n9. Unfavorable publicity.  \n10. Lowered Team Member morale.  \n11. Unfavorable impact on bottom line profit.  \n12. Personal discomfort and inconvenience to the injured Team Member.  \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  50 \n \nDo it the Safe Way  \n \nHere are some pointers management can use at a safety training session for food service \nTeam Members concerning the four most prevalent types of accidents that occur in food \nservice operations.  \n \nStrains due to improper lifting  \n \n1. Lift trays or any object, using the leg muscle, not your back.  (See lifting procedures ) \n \nFalls  \n1. Keep fl oors clean; wipe up spilled foods, grease, etc.  immediately . \n2. Keep floors and aisles clear of obstructions.  \n3. Do not  stand on boxes, tables, or chairs to reach objects.  Use proper size ladder or \nstep stool .  Do not overreach . \n4. When carrying anything, do not allow your view to become blocked.  \n \nCuts  \n1. Use knives properly ; keep them sharp.  \n2. If a knife falls, do not  try to catch it.  Let it fall . \n3. Use care in removing broken glass.  Don\u2019t pick it up \u2014sweep it up! Remove  slivers \nwith dampened paper.  \n4. Never hand -feed slicing machines.  \n5. Use cut gloves at all times.  \n \nBurns  \n1. Assume that every pot or steam table pan is hot. \n2. Keep handles turned  inward . \n3. Open hot water or other hot liquid faucets slowly to avoid splashes . \n4. Tip pot covers toward you  to release steam in opposite d irection . \n5. Get assistance  where necessary to handle heavy, hot utensils . \n \nLifting Procedures  \n \nChin UP!  This automatically puts the back into a position ready for lifting.  \n \nFeet \n \nPlace feet about as far apart as the width of your musters with one foot a little ahead of \nthe other.  Stand directly facing the object  to be lifted, and as close to the object as \npossible.  \n \nThe farther away from the load you stand, the more strain it puts on your back.   For \nexample, assume the weight of the load is 20 pounds and you have to stand three feet  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  51 \n \naway in order to lift it.  The strain of lifting it is equal to the weight of the load times the \ndistance, or 20 lbs. x 3 ft = 60 lbs.  Not an easy lift anymore is it?  \n \nKnees  \n \nBend your knees  to help you straddle the load and develop leverage  as you pick it up or \nput it down.  In the bent position, get as close to the load  as possible.  \n \nBack  \n \nThe back actually must be referred to as the spinal column and back muscles.  The spinal \ncolumn is mad e up of bones; the cushiony, spongy discs between the bones; the \nligaments; and the muscles that hold the bones upright and together.  \n \nWhen your spinal column is held correctly,  it can support a substantial amount of weight; \nalthough when you bend or twist  your spinal column to lift something, the bones are \n\u201ctilted\u201d and unable to bear as great a load.  Twisting the body  in order to pick up or put \ndown a load can lead to back injury .   Remember to lift the object gradually .  Jerky lifting \nmotions  can put a s udden strain on the spinal column or muscles and cause injury . \n \nHands and Fingers  \n \nProperly gripping the object to be lifted is very important.  Use one hand underneath to \nsupport the load.  Place the other across the top and grip the far edge.  Avoid gett ing your \nfingers pinched when you put down the object by setting one corner down first.  While \ncarrying a carton, DO NOT attempt to ADJUST YOUR GRIP WHILE IN MOTION.  \nSTOP, REST it on a support, and THEN make the change.  \n \nStomach  \n \nAbdominal  as well as back  muscles play a part in lifting.  Too heavy a load or sudden \ntwists can cause a strain in the abdominal muscles.  \n \nIf the load is too heavy, get help ; either a material moving device such as hand truck or \nforklift, or another person.  Two or more people lif ting a load requires  teamwork .  If one \nperson on the \u201cteam\u201d lifts too soon, shifts the load, or lowers the load improperly , either \nperson may be overloaded or overstrained.  It is wiser to decide in advance who will give \nthe orders to coordinate all the moves.  Once the order is given, don\u2019t change your mind \nat the last second to get a better grip or shift your position!  This has been the cause of \nmany accidents.  \n \nWhen carrying objects, many people rest the object against their stomachs to lighten the \nload.  In doing this, they will be leaning backward causing the spinal column to be bent, \nthus putting unnecessary stress on both their muscles and spine.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  52 \n \nEyes  \n \nDon\u2019t allow the load you\u2019re carrying to block your vision causing you to trip over unseen \nobjects . \n \nThe answer to all the following questions must be \u201cyes\u201d prior to lifting and carrying a \nheavy or bulky load:  \n \n1. Is the route to be taken clear and properly illuminated both upstairs and downstairs?  \n2. Is the object free of nails, sharp corners, loose metal straps or splinters?  \n3. Am I wearing the protective equipment to handle it safely, i.e. gloves, apron, goggles \nor foot protection?  \n4. Am I remembering to place the short object on top of the long, and the narrow on top \nof the wide?  \n \nSummation  \n \nThe lifting position for each person will vary slightly depending on their height and \nweight.  The key points to remember are:  \n \n1. Check the planned route.  Decide on how to best grasp the object and make sure the \nload is easily within your lifting capacity.  \n2. Position fee t and squat close to the load.  \n3. Get a good grip and lift gradually using your leg muscles as much as possible and the \nleverage created by your bent knee.  Keep the load close to the body.  \n4. Make sure the object is close to you when lifting and keep it close w hen carrying.  \nMake sure you can see where you are going.  \n \nReceiving and Storing  \n \n1. When opening boxes, crates, etc, use the proper tool designed for removing nails, \nwire, or sharp metal bands.  Remove these objects and discard immediately.  \n2. Store heavy material on bottom shelves, medium weight on the next shelves, \nlightweight and breakables on top.  \n3. Keep food containers covered in refrigerators when not in use.  \n4. When opening edibles, examine for possible foreign matter.  \n5. In handling boxes, crates, or any fo od material follow rules for safe lifting.  Use \nladders to reach for anything too high for you.  Do not stand on crates, boxes, or \ntrashcans.  \n6. Use handles to open and close drawers.  \n7. Store all insecticides, pesticides, disinfectants, and washing compounds in  areas away \nfrom food or food -handling areas.  Do not store on shelves above food preparation or \nfood-handling areas.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  53 \n \n8. All walk -in boxes must have a bump handle release.  When coming out of a walk -in \nbox, open door gradually.  \n \nThe Kitchen  \n \n1. Grills, fryers, blenders, freezers, and slicers can all cause accidents if mishandled.  \n2. Never allow any machine to be used unless the Team Member has been trained to use \nit properly.  Make certain that all safety devices are in place before using.  \n3. Do not wear loose clothin g (open shirt, sleeves, neckties, apron strings) or jewelry \naround any machinery or equipment.  \n4. Pull plug on any piece of equipment that is not direct -wired or throw breaker on any \ndirect -wired piece of machinery before cleaning or adjusting any machine.  \n5. Keep fingers, hands, knives or spoons away from moving parts.  \n6. Keep fingers, hands and arms out of all equipment.  \n7. All electrical kitchen equipment must be grounded.  \nKnives  \n \n1. The sharper the knife, the less chance of injury.  It cuts more easily, takes less \npressure, and has less chance of slipping.  \n2. Pick knives up by the handle, never by the blade.  Put them away in racks when not in \nuse.  Never cover them with a cloth, even tempo rarily; you may forget they are there.  \n3. In handling knives:  \na. Cut away from your body or hand.  \nb. Use cut glove at all times  \nc. When drying a knife, keep the sharp edge away from you.  \nd. Never leave knives in the sink or water, or where they cannot be easily seen.  \ne. Properly dispose of all knives that are worn, broken, or have loose handles.  \n4. Do not put dirty knives into a tub of soapy water where it cannot be seen.  \nSomeone may reach in and cut themselves.  \nFloors  \n \n1. Spilled liquids, grease and food cause most slips and fal ls in the kitchen area.  \n2. Keep floors clean and dry.  \n3. If you spill it \u2013 wipe it up immediately!  \n4. If you drop it \u2013 pick it up immediately!  \n5. Tile floors may be slippery when the weather is humid.  Take special care to avoid \nslips and falls.  Wipe tile floors periodically when weather is humid.  \n6. Shoes - wear proper shoes such as rubber or crepe soles (must say non -slip on the \nbox) to avoid slips and falls.  \n7. Walk; do not run across the floor.  \n8. Keep floor clear of utensils, boxes, or pieces of food.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  54 \n \nTrash disposal  \n \n1. Do not let containers overflow.  \n2. Keep garbage can lids on tightly.  \n3. If plastic disposal bags are used, be sure that they are tied securely.  \n4. All lids from can must be put back into the can or in a box so when you compact \ngarbage with your hand you do not cut yourself.  \n \nDining Room Area  \n \n1. Subdued lighting must never be so dim that movement required for serving is unsafe.  \n2. A routine inspection conducted at least once a day must be established to inspect \nchairs, stools, counters, and tables for broken parts, splint ers, and loose joints. If such \nfaulty items are found, they must be removed from the area and repaired or replaced.  \nHygiene and Sanitation  \n \nIn eight hours, one bacteria cell, under certain conditions, can multiply into a family of \nover thirty -five trillion, causing food poisoning to your customers.  \nThis is an extremely threatening condition for a business.  There are two things that must \nbe done to control bacteria and prevent hazardous conditions.  \n \n1. Insist Team Members follow good personal hygien e and sanitation procedures.  \n2. Keep food refrigerated and covered.  In this way, the amount of bacteria that is \nalready present or enters the food is controlled.  Proper refrigeration ---below 40\u00b0F \nretards the rapid multiplication of bacteria.  Maintaining  a temperature of 140\u00b0 F or \nover discourages bacteria in hot foods.  \n \nTeam Members must be checked out by the medical department or a doctor if they have \nthe following symptoms:  \n \n1. Gastrointestinal disorders.  \n2. Sore throat or persistent cough.  \n3. Skin lesions, boi ls on hands or other parts of body.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  55 \n \nTeam Members must be made aware of the importance of washing their hands often with \nsoap and hot water.  Specifically, hands must be washed:  \n \n1. After using restrooms.  \n2. After smoking.  \n3. Anytime you touch your hair or skin.  \n4. Before any food prep activity.  \n5. After handling money.  \n6. After busing tables.  \n7. After mopping or sweeping.  \n8. After putting stock away.  \n9. Upon return from a break.  \n10. Before you clock into work.  \n11. After emptying trash.  \n12. After daily cleanup.  \n13. Before handling any food or clean utensils.  \n \nIn other words, anytime you may have picked up bacteria from a non -sanitary surface.  \nWashing hands often with soap and water and drying them with a sanitary towel will \nreduce the transfer of harmful bacteria from your hands to other food contact surfaces.  \nSummation  \n \nHeat hot foods to over 140\u00b0 F as fast as possible and keep them at that temperature or \nchill them as quickly as possible.  Cold foods must be chilled to below 40\u00b0 F as quickly \nas possible.  Do not prolong preparation of foods.  Deviating from the desirable \ntemperatures for too long invites bacteria that we try to control.  \n \nHere are three rules to follow concerning food safety and sanitation:  \n \n1. Keep it hot or keep it cold.  \n2. Keep it covered.  \n3. When in doubt\u2026throw it out!  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  56 \n \nGeneral Electrical Safety  \n \n1. Use quality electrical equipment; look for the underwriters label (signifying approved \nby the underwriters laboratory) on the equipment.  \n2. Only qualified electricians must be permitted to perform electrical work.  \n3. Stay off wet or da mp footing areas when using electrical appliances.  Do not use \nelectrical equipment while standing in the rain.  Keep your hands dry.  \n4. Use the appropriate sizes of electrical cords (light or heavy -duty).  \n5. Never pull the plug out of an outlet by yanking the c ord. \n6. Motors must be used in accordance with their designated horsepower - do not \noverload.  \n7. Any small shocks from equipment are a warning of leaking electricity and must be \nrepaired immediately.  \n8. All portable electric tools must be grounded and their power always turned off when \nnot in use.  \n9. Set up a preventative maintenance inspection system for electrical equipment to \nprevent electrical hazards before someone is injured.  \n10. All electrical installations and utilization of equipment shall be installed and \nmainta ined in accordance with the provision of the national electrical code nfpa 70 -\n1968 (ansi -c-i-1968).  \n \nFire Hazards  \n \nIn the event of a fire occurring at a restaurant, it is up to the management to take charge \nof the situation.  Fires vary greatly is size and  nature, sound judgment must be applied.  \nIn general, there are two major objectives to be accomplished:  \n \n1. Eliminate the danger to customers and employees.  \n2. Minimize damage to the store premises.  \n \nFire Prevention  \n \n1. Keep combustible material and supplies a saf e distance from hot water heaters and \nother cooking equipment.  \n2. Practice good housekeeping at all times.  \n3. Clean filters and hoods on cooking equipment on a regular basis.  \n4. Check gas jets and pilot lights frequently.  Promptly report any odor of gas.  \n5. Do not ov erload outlets or use temporary wiring.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  57 \n \nFire Emergency Plan  \n \nThe key to the success of any emergency plan during an actual emergency is that store \npersonnel are given specific responsibilities and instructed on how to perform these \nduties before the eme rgency occurs.  \n \n1. Train all Team Members in the use of the fire extinguishers.  \n2. Show all Team Members where the gas cut -offs are and how to turn off the gas \nmains.  Keep a wrench or pliers near that location.  \n3. Show all Team Members where the circuit breakers are.  Ensure that the markings are \nclear.  \n4. Pre-arrange responsibilities in the event of a fire.  \n \nAccidents and New Employees  \n \nSurveys show that 60 percent of all accidents involve Team Members who have been \nwith a company less than one year.  In the restaurant business, at any given time, there \nare a number of Team Members working in our restaurants that are relatively new.  They  \nwork during peak periods, full -time and part -time.  Therefore, extra effort must be made \nto make the Team Members \u201csafe for the job and the job safe for the Team Members\u201d.  \n \nThe first step is to carefully interview the applicant, and determine that the per son is \nsuited to do the job.  \n \nOnce management has ascertained that the applicant is qualified, the next step is to make \ncertain that the new Team Members receives all the proper safety instructions.  \n \nStress that each Team Member is responsible for his/her owns safety and obeying safety \nrules is a condition of employment!  \n \nNew Team Member safety indoctrination must not stop here.  \n \nBeginning with the Team Members first day at work, the manager must spend time \npointing out safety procedures and potentially uns afe conditions that may be encountered \non the job.  Stress the importance of having a \u201csafe job\u201d attitude.  \n \nThe number of part -time personnel employed by Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s places  additional \nimportance on the need for thorough safety training.  Many part -time Team Members are \nstudents who have already completed a full day in class when they arrive at work.  They \nmust adjust to a completely different environment.  It is imperative that our safety \nprocedures and regulations be reviewed periodically with Tea m Members.  Only in this \nway can we prevent injury and retain our excellent safety record.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  58 \n \nAccident Investigating and Reporting  \n \nAccident investigation is a fact -finding process.  The objective of an accident report is to:  \n \n1. Obtain complete and true information about the alleged accident or incident.  \n2. Identify hazardous conditions and unsafe acts or practices.  \n3. Give the accident investigator as much as possible to help process the claim.  \n \nKeep the Atmosphere of the Investigation Informal.  \n \n1. Do not put the verbal comments of witnesses in writing while they are giving their \naccounts of the accident.  \n2. Wait until you are away from witnesses to write your report.  You can always check \nyour written report with them to verify that the facts they reported ar e accurate.  \n \nUse Common Sense:  Stick to the Facts.  \n \n1. Make no assumptions and take nothing for granted.  \n2. Do not look upon the accident investigation as additional work, but rather as an \nopportunity to correct an unsafe situation.  \n \nInvestigate Each Sequence.  \n \nAn apparently reasonable conclusion will often be changed by exploring facts that were \nnot considered important enough to be mentioned.  \n \nCheck for Unsafe Conditions and Actions.  \n \nState what unsafe conditions contributed to the accident. They are always pr esent when \naccidents occur.  Give reasons for their existence, if possible.  List any unsafe acts \ninvolved.  Why did they occur?  Note: never accept an investigation report that says an \nemployee was \u201ccareless\u201d.  This is a result, never a cause.  If you thi nk the employee was \ncareless, find out why.  There is always a cause.  \n \nMake the necessary recommendations for corrective action to your supervisor and send a \ncopy to the corporate insurance department.  \n \nFollow up to see that the corrective recommendations have been put into effect.  \n \nThe following questions and answers will help you in accident investigations.  \n \n1. Which accidents must be investigated? All of them.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  59 \n \n2. When must the accident investigation be made? Immediately after the accident.  \nDelays can permit p ertinent evidence to be removed or change and important \ninformation forgotten.  \n3. What questions are necessary to accident investigation?  There are six basic questions \nthat must be answered:  \na. Who was injured?  \nb. When did it happen?  \nc. Why did it occur?  \nd. What were th e unsafe conditions or unsafe practices involved?  \ne. Where did it happen?  \nf. How did it happen?  \n4. Must separate accident reports be used for Team Member and Guest accidents? Yes.  \nCertain types of information for one do not have to be recorded for the other.  (See  \nsections of employee injury and public injury).  \n5. Who must investigate accidents? The store manager is the most logical person to \nmake the investigation.  The manager is best informed concerning every phase of \nwork operations in the restaurant.  Accident pr evention is proper safety training, \nsupervision and follow -up. \n \nTeam Member Injury Procedures  \n \nWhen a Team Member is injured while working, the manager or person in charge must:  \n1. Do whatever can be done to ob tain the extent of injury without further injuri ng the \nTeam Member?  \n2. Correct any unsafe conditions to prevent a recurrence of the accident.  \n3. Require Team Member to receive first aid and/or medical treatment.  Even minor \ninjuries must receive first aid to prevent them from turning into serious problems.  \n4. If Team Member goes to a doctor/hospital, do not allow him/her to return to work \nwithout a doctor\u2019s release.  \n \nSerious Injuries  \n \n1. Call an ambulance and/or doctor.  If Team Member can be moved without risking \nfurther injury, take them to our medical care provider in your area.  \n2. Notify a relative or close friend of the injured person.  (Check employment \napplication for emergency information).  \n3. Call your Supervisor immediately.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  60 \n \nInstruct the Team Member who goes to a medical care provider to:  \n \n1. Report or have  someone report to you the status of the injury/illness and the \nappropriate return -to-work date.  \n2. Have the medical care provider complete a return to work slip before returning to \nwork.  \n3. Schedule checkups following the injury/illness during non -scheduled wor k hours.  \n \nReport of Injury  \n \nWhenever a Team Member accident occurs, a record of the accident must be immediately \nsupplied to our insurance company.       \n \nYou will be talking to various individuals, the injured Team Member, as well as other \nTeam Members an d witnesses.  Your goal in the investigation is not to establish fault, but \nto establish and correct the cause.  Employees will omit vital points in their exchanges \nwith management if they fear repercussions from their statements, either from their \nmanager  or fellow Team Members.  \n \nInformation required in completing the first report of injury:  \n \n1. Team Member name and social security number.  Both are mandatory.  \n2. Restaurant location.  Give the location of the Team Members permanently assigned \nstore.  \n3. Occupation/job assignment at time of accident.  \n4. Date and time of injury or initial diagnosis of injury.  Mandatory.  Include hour, and \n\u201cam\u201d or \u201cpm.\u201d  \n5.

For the company to recover money for losses, obtain and record as much information \nas possible, such as:  \n \n\uf0b7 Name, address, phone number and driver\u2019s license number of persons involved, \nincluding witnesses.  \n\uf0b7 Description and license number of any vehic le involved in an accident.  \n\uf0b7 List and description of damaged items.  \n\uf0b7 Date, time and conditions of the accident.  \n\uf0b7 Any other pertinent data.  \n \nMake certain all Team Members are trained to make no liability statements and \nto gather all pertinent data.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  65 \n \nSecurity  \n \nRegister Security  \n \nSince you work with money, you must also be concerned with robbery, internal theft or \nshort -change artists.  This is a serious subject, and you must follow these procedures very \ncarefully to maintain proper safekeeping of the restauran t\u2019s employees and assets.  \n \nWhen leaving the register for any reason, keep both security and customers in mind.  This \nmeans you must:  \n\uf0b7 Lock the register . \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the register and on the line for upcoming guest.  \n\uf0b7 Never keep guest waiting at the register .  \n \nIn addition, you must keep the register locked when you\u2019re not at the cashier station to \nkeep delivery or service personnel (or even fellow employees) from opening the register \nand taking money from the register.  Often it\u2019s hard to believe one of your  fellow workers \nwould steal money, but it does occasionally happen.  Remember, you will be held \naccountable for shortages in your cash drawer.  \n \nShort -change Artists  \n \nDO NOT interrupt a transaction to discuss anything. Quick change artists and \ncounterfeiters may try to get you confused.  Sometimes they work in pairs.  \n1. If interrupted, say: \u201cJust a moment, please.  I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d  \n2. Finish transaction.  \n3. Then say: \u201c Thank you for waiting.  How may I help you?\u201d  \n4. If, when you are counting back money they interrupt to ask for additional change or \nfor additional purchase, tell them you will take care of them as soon as you finish \ncounting back their money.  Criminals often  try to confuse the CASHIER with an \ninterruption.  DON\u2019T let it happen to you.  \n\uf0b7 DO NOT take money from two people at the same time.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the bill on the register shelf until you finish transaction.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the drawer closed when ringing up the order.  \n \nIf they give you currency that has handwriting or any other obvious marks on it, make a \ncasual comment about it.  Some quick -change artists work in pairs in order to have the \nfirst one use a larger denomination marked bill, and when the second one comes th rough \nthe line, he will use a smaller bill.  But once the change has been given, and the drawer is \nclosed, he will politely say there may have been a mistake and he gave you a larger bill.  \nTo convince you, he will even refer to a specific handwritten note  or mark on the larger \nbill.  You look in your drawer and find the very bill he is referring to, and if you hadn\u2019t  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  66 \n \nnoticed it before, you may feel compelled to return the extra change.  After all, he sounds \nso convincing and so harmless.  \n \nCounterfeit Mone y \n \nCounterfeiters usually deal only with large bills (i.e. Twenties, fifties, hundreds) although \noccasionally they will use $5 or $10 bills.  \n \nConsult with your manager on how to recognize counterfeit bills.  If you suspect you \nhave been given a counterfei t bill, you must do the following:  \n\uf0b7 Do not  return it to the Guest until the manager has instructed you to do so.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  physically grab the Guest. This could lead to a lawsuit if the money is \nNOT counterfeit!  \n\uf0b7 Do not  accuse the Guest.  You are not a government agent, so don\u2019t try to act like \none.  \n\uf0b7 Call the manager immediately . \n \nRobbery  \n \nIf a robbery occur s at the register during business hours, it is important to remember one \nword \u201c Cooperate\u201d.   Do not try to be a hero or resist a robbery attempt.  Your life is more \nvaluable than the money in the drawer.  \n \nIf a robbery must occur, do the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Do whatever the robber asks within reason.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and avoid sudden movements.  \n\uf0b7 Give the robber all the money in the register.  \n\uf0b7 Be alert and notice features (height, weight, attire, color of eyes, scars, etc\u2026) \ndon\u2019t  be obvious about this ! \n\uf0b7 Contact the manager immediately after they leave and have someone call the \npolice.  \n \nSome things you can do to red uce the risks of robbery:  \n \n\uf0b7 Be aware of suspicious -acting guests.  \n\uf0b7 Be suspicious of guests who ask questions about how much business you do each \nday, who stare at the money in the drawer, or who linger near the cashier area for \nno apparent reason, or people who stay in the restaurant for a long period of time \nwithout eati ng or drinking anything.  \n\uf0b7 Make frequent money drops during your shift, removing all large bills from your \nregister. Check with your manager on how and when to do this.  \n\uf0b7 Keep the cash register door closed at all times except when conducting sales \ntransactio ns.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  67 \n \n\uf0b7 Keep the register key in a hidden location.  \n \nSecurity in our units is paramount. There are factions in our society that will try and \ninitiate criminal activities against restaurants. Please read carefully and do not put your \nunit, management staff or team members in harm\u2019s way.  \n \nOpening Procedures  \n\uf0b7 In the morning, circle the building in your vehicle checking to see if all the doors \nare secured before entering. When in doubt be cautious, don\u2019t go in. Call the \npolice to clear the building before entering.   \n \nDeposits and Cash Handling  \n \nWhen making a deposit, try to vary the time you go to the bank. Do not let it be routine. \nMake deposits during the daylight hours.  When going to the bank be aware of any \nsuspicious looking vehicles. If you identify any, ride  by and come back at a different \ntime.  \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on bushes, trees or any other obstacles that could be used as a place \nto hide while waiting for a depositor.  \n\uf0b7 Make cash drops regularly so that you never have over $400 in the cash drawer.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving to make a deposit do not run any other errands before making the \ndeposit. Go straight to the bank. Money left in the car is an easy target.  \n\uf0b7 When going to the bank to make a deposit make sure that when coming to a stop \nlight you leave plenty of space in between cars so that you cannot be boxed in \neasily and are able to maneuver your car out of the space.  \n\uf0b7 If there are pedestrians in the vicinity make sure you are aware of their \nmovements and how close they are to your vehicle. Chose the farthest distance \nfrom them.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving with money do not make it apparent that you are carrying a deposit.  \n\uf0b7 If possible when transporting money to or from the unit try to have someone meet \nyou at your car outside the front door while you are in your vehicle. Walking from  \nthe far end of the parking lot with large amounts of money makes you an easy \ntarget.  \n\uf0b7 Always count money in a secure place out of the view of Guest s and Team \nMembers. The office must be used to count money and always have the door \nclosed and locked. Team Members do not need to know the cash handling aspects \nof our business or how much cash may be on the property at a time.  \n\uf0b7 Have 2 drawers available so that the drawers can be switched out seamlessly \nduring the mid shift and the other drawer counted in the of fice. While counting \ndown the AM drawer make sure to have someone monitoring the shift. It must \ntake no longer than 10 minutes to count down the mid shift drawer.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  68 \n \nDeliveries  \n \n\uf0b7 When accepting deliveries, make sure to be aware of the surroundings before \nopening the door. Shut the door securely and then check in the product. Walk the \ndelivery agents to the door and let them out after the surroundings have been \nobserved and then secure the door.  \n\uf0b7 The back door must never be left unattended. A manager must alway s be present.  \n \nStructure Security  \n \n\uf0b7 Locate the main breaker boxes that are outside the building during the day time \nand ensure they are secure. If the lights go out in the building do not run outside. \nThis may be a rouse to get the door open. If lights do go out remain inside, call \nthe polic e to come and check out the building and surrounding before opening the \ndoor.  \n\uf0b7 Install a peep hole on the back door and/or mirrors to allow you to see around \ncorners.  \n\uf0b7 Put an alarm bar on the back door. The alarm bar must always be in place. The \ndoor must remain closed after dark.  \n\uf0b7 If you have cameras make sure they are functioning.  \n\uf0b7 A well -lit place will not be as easy a target. If lights are out around your building mak e \nsure to quickly get them replaced. Criminals will stage their crime scenes well.  \n \n \nPublic Relations  \n \n\uf0b7 Cater to law enforcement guests when they come in. Thank them regularly for the \nhard work they perform and for patrolling your area. The more times you have the \nPolice seen in and around your building the more secure you will be.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  69 \n \nClosing Procedures  \n \n\uf0b7 Leave for the night  in pairs. The last 2 people must follow this procedure. First \nlook both ways out the door and let the first person go.  After they are  secure in \ntheir car and have observed the surroundings, flash your headlights to the person \ninside. The first person out must wait until the second person is safely in their car \nand car is started before leaving. The person inside must be close to a phone  ready \nto call 911 if the first person out is accosted.  Do not hesitate time is crucial.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  allow anybody in th e building after closing except  for those closing the \nshift. This includes off the clock Team Members or family members of someone \nworking. People waiting to give an employee a ride must wait outside.  \n\uf0b7 Do not let the Team Members exit or enter from the back door.  \n\uf0b7 After closing hours, lock the door even if there is still guest in the restaurant. Let \nthem out when they want to go. Be observant of all areas outside before opening \nthe door, someone could be hiding nearby.  \n\uf0b7 Be aware of any suspicious people that come in just before closing.  \n\uf0b7 Make your last trash run before dark and attend the door during the run. During \ndaylight savings time make tra sh runs early in the evening. Leave the last trash \ncontainer inside and dispose of it in the morning. The manager must be present at \nthe door during the trash run to ensure someone is not hiding behind the dumpster \nand then walking your team member in the back door.  \n\uf0b7 Before closing and after the late night guest are out of the front parking spaces \nmove your vehicles closer to the unit. Try and park away from any other cars so \nyou will have a clear view around your vehicle upon leaving. Do not park around \nobstructions in the area such as trees, bushes, landscaping accoutrements etc.  \n\uf0b7 When going to your vehicle make sure your key is in your hand and ready to open \nthe door.  \n\uf0b7 Do not carry numerous items out with you late which will prevent you from \nquickly enter ing your vehicle.  \n\uf0b7 If you have to scrape ice off your windows be observant of your surrounding \nduring the process.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  70 \n \nCrisis Management  \n \nIn the case of a Natural Disasters which would include the following circumstances  \n \n\uf0b7 Tornado  \n\uf0b7 Hurricane  \n\uf0b7 Flood  \n\uf0b7 Major Power Outage  \n \nThe following steps must take place.  \n\uf0b7 Secure the unit by moving all Guests and Team Members away from windows, \ndoors and patio.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and move those in the building to a safe place i.e. Prep area, Walk -\nin Cooler, Restrooms.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all p eople calm and monitor the situation. If possible monitor TV to see the \nstatus and when all is clear for business to resume.  \n \nYour Guests and Team Members will be looking for you to control the situation. During \na team meeting discuss the proper steps that  would be taken if such occurrence takes \nplace.  \n \nIf there is a power outage call the power company to get updates on when power will be \nrestored, it may only be a matter of minutes. As soon the power company is called inform \nyour supervisor and seek knowle dge. \n \nIn the case of Media on Premises regarding a situation the following steps must be taken.  \n \n\uf0b7 Be polite and let them know you need a few minutes.

Do not look at the bottom of \nthis page!  \n \nThe cost of training one hourly Team Member is?  \n \n1. $850  \n2. $980  \n3. $1099  \n4. $1508  \n5. $2077  \n6. $2200 \n7. $2400  \n \nThe cost of losing a family of 4 who had a bad experience and tells 10 of their friends \nwill be lost Top Line  sales of?  \n \n1. $750  \n2. $980  \n3. $1190  \n4. $1800  \n5. $2400  \n6. $5000  \n7. $9000  \n \nThis scenario is based upon a family of 4 with a check average of $25 visiting 3 times per \nmonth. That total would be $75 a month. Assume that this family\u2019s bad experience is \nshared with 10 other families of 4 who will never dine with us because of this 1 bad \nexperience and 1 poor recommendation! Here is how the numbers work:  \n \n$75 per month with each family of 4 dinning 3 times per month times the 10 families!  \nThat number is $750 in lost sales for 1 month. Take that $750 and annualize that!  \nYou have lost $9000 in sales due to 1 bad experience that a Family of 4 had.  \n \nThis scenario could  be very real. It is a fact that for every bad experience a Guest has in \nthe service industry, they tell 10 people! Think about your past negative experiences you \nhad while dinning. Did you go back? Did you tell anyone about your experience?  \n \nThe answer t o question 1 is number 7=$2400! According to People Report  in 2004 the \ncost for training 1 Team Member was $2400. This cost includes: training wages, wages \nto the trainers, cost of management time spent with new hire, cost of uniform, cost of \nmanuals, cost  in food waste, and payroll taxes.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 -

When writing your BURGER goals or your managers are writing their goals \nuse the Key Characteristics and the Manager Criticals as a bench mark in your \npreparation.  \n \nRunning 14 great shifts per week (14/14) is the number one priority for each member of \nthe management team. If we are not running a great 14/14 we run the risk of delivering \npoor service or food to a first time Guest. You as a manager  must ensure the proper \nscheduling coverage is provided in each of those shifts. Your heavy volume shifts will be \nFriday am/pm, Saturday am/pm, and Sunday am/pm. These account for over 60% of your \nbusiness. As the General Manager you want to be on duty these shifts to ensure the Team \nis executing to 100% of the standard.  \n \nThese days are real Game Days, in football terms. Every shift is live and the game has \nbegun! When writing the manager schedule t he General Manager (The Head Coach) must \nbe working each Game Day. It is suggested that Monday morning is the best time for the \nGeneral Manager to be doing administrative office work including:  \n \n\uf0b7 Inventory  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing your key cost areas: Food Cost/Paper/Labo r \n\uf0b7 Doing the weekly Profit loss Statement  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing last week\u2019s  sales  \n\uf0b7 Forecasting the coming week\u2019s sales/labor  \n\uf0b7 Marketing strategy meetings  \n\uf0b7 Holding Manager meetings/suggested 2 per month  \n\uf0b7 Manager or Key Team Member  1on1\u2019s/suggested 4 per month  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing Ord er Books  \n \nThink of this in terms of the head football coach. He is watching films from last week and \nplanning for his upcoming game.  \n \nThe GM/Franchisee must make time to review and get the team focused for the upcoming \nweek.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 97 \n \nQualifying Your Team  \n \nDeveloping your team is one of the best ways to insure your success. Providing the time \nand resources to make someone great promotes you as a great leader and team builder.  \nThis ensures that everybody is knowledgeable and efficient at their jobs. When tea m \nmembers know the expectations and have a knowledge base to draw from they get much \nmore proficient at a task.  Having numerous individuals effective at different positions \ngives you the flexibility to have a maximum impact  on the operation and your shif t. \n \nEach week you must be meeting with your fellow managers to discuss the team\u2019s training \nneeds. Identify who needs development and plan for it. If you don\u2019t have the time to \ndevelop your team you will fight endless battles during each shift. Investing in  training \ntime with your team members will pay off in the form of smoother shifts and increase the \ntime you have to build sales later on.  \n \nYour team members must be tested on each position of the restaurant. You can verbally \nqualify the team by asking ques tions about each task they are performing.  \n \nHuman Resources  \n \nCounseling Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Identify the problem, giving specifics in a calm and friendly fashion.  \n3. Ask the employee for his/her input on the problem, paraphrasing the informatio n \nhe/she provides.  \n4. Ask the employee for a plan.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out the commitments.  \n6. Agree on a time and place to follow -up. \n \nDisciplining Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Review the problem discussed in the previous meeting, what was agreed to, and w hat \nhas happened since.  \n3. Ask the team member for his /her input, paraphrasing the information he/she \nprovides.  \n4. Ask the team member what he/she plans to do.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out commitments.  \n6.

Managers must lead by \nexample by showing an excellent work ethic , following Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  \nand procedures, and displaying outstanding Guest service.  \n \nAs managers, you have to realize how important our role is. The  Guest experience is \ndirectly impacted by how we organize our crew and utilize our time and the team\u2019s time.  \n \nEnforcing Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Standards   \n \nIn addition to exemplifying the model Team Member, managers will also take an active \nrole in enforcing  Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  as they apply to food quality, \ncleanliness, employee hygiene, uniforms, and service. The following must be consistently \nenforced each and every shift.  \n \n1. Quality of food  \u2013 Only the freshest, hottest product must be served to the Guest. \nInsure that quality line checks are getting done before each shift. Take this time to \nguarantee all products meet our standards. They need to meet the FAT test. \nF=Flavor A=Appearance T=Temperature . If we are 100% in compliance with the \nFAT profi le we will exceed what the Guest expects.   \n2. Hygiene \u2013Team Members must be neatly groomed each and every time they come to \nwork.  Baths, deodorants, mouthwashes, and colognes are all known to be protective \nmeasures.  Hair must be cleaned and neatly combed; long hair must be restrained. \nArrive to work in 100% proper uniform.  \n3. Uniforms \u2013Team Members must be instructed as to the designated uniform to be \nworn in the restaurant.  The Cheeseburger  Bobby\u2019s  uniform  includes: black, non -slip \nsoled shoes (no sneakers), black belt, and pressed black pants, pressed Cheeseburger \nBobby\u2019s shirt , name tag  and Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s hat.  This uniform must be worn \nat all times and with all of the accessories issued. The most i mportant part of your \nuniform is a sincere SMILE ! A smile is such a critical part of our uniform. A great \nSmile radiates a contagious feeling to your fellow Team Members and our Guest.  \n4. Service \u2013 The distinguishing feature of Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s is our ou tstanding \nGuest service.  As a result, managers must make Guest service their number one \npriority.  You only get one chance to make a first impression with our Guest. We \nmust WOW our Guests with awesome service and great food.  \n5. Sanitation - Our Guests like to know they are eating in a clean, sanitized and well run \nbusiness. Every Team Member must be very conscious of sanitation, using gloves \nwhen required and washing their hands often. Keeping your Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nclean is everyone on t he TEAMS job.  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s basic operating principles are the heart to our success. Each of \nthese principles is basic and simple to execute. Each must become standard behaviour in  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 99 \n \nthe execution of running shifts. It must be clear to all managers that being active with \nGuests and Team Members during hours of Operation is a standard requirement. Between \nthe hours of 11a.m. -2 p.m. and between the hours of 5p.m. -9p.m. a manager or Key team \nmember must be out front on the floor. If you must leave for a ny reason communicate to \nthe shift leader.  \n \nThe Home Base Principle : This is a simple principle that leads to great execution.  \n \nWhen running a shift one of the key locations for the manager  to always be keyed into is \nthe make table. From there 100% of the  food quality and most of the service and \ncleanliness standards can be managed identified and rectified by the manager or by \ngiving direction to a team member. When working your 8 steps always return to HOME \nBASE.  \n \nGetting out from behind the line must tak e place about every 20 minutes.  \nAdditionally, as the manager walks the dining room he/she must also be quickly checking \nthe restrooms for cleanliness and stocking issues. Walk the back of the house to follow up \non the prep, dish and storage procedures.  \n \nLittle time must be spent in the office. Our business is so simplistic that during open \nhours the manager must not be in the office at all. It is imperative to the success of the \nbusiness to focus on what is inside the 4 walls in the front of the house. Wh en leaving \nHome Base always manage these 2 important action plans:  \n \n1. Praise the appropriate behaviors; this promotes more of the same.  \n \n2. Coach to the standard, if you do not address substandard work quality you in essence \nmake a new standard. When you don\u2019t address inappropriate work behavior the Team \nMember thinks that you don\u2019t really know the standard yourself and lose respect for \nyou as well.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 100 \n \nRunning a Quality Shift: Managing the 8\u2019s  \n \nBelow are the Managers Figure 8\u2019s items.

Never say no to a Guest request, even though it may sound outrageous, e ither do it or \noffer an alternative . \n \nHelpful Management Tips  \n \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the parking lot. When you see numerous cars pull in you can \nassume that you will need burger patties. Get them on the grill. It will take them \nabout 1 -2 minutes to get in the door, 1 -2 minutes to place their order, get cups, \nand pay. By the time they get to their table their order must almost be completed.  \n\uf0b7 You must have the appropriate par levels of baskets to get through a busy shift \nwithout having to was h any. This situation gives you the ability to focus on \nturning tables and taking care of the guest rather than constantly monitoring \nequipment amounts during peak volume.  \n\uf0b7 Cross -utilize your staff effectively. If you need more tables cleaned pull team \nmem bers from other areas to assist getting tables cleaned. Remember the more  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 104 \n \npositions your team members can perform the more efficient and flexible your \nrestaurant can be run. Imagine a work force where everyone can perform in every \nposition. You then have f lexibility, numerous trainers and the power to discipline \nyour team when needed without the fear of that member walking out leaving you \nhigh and dry.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your OMC checklists are completed. The best way to prepare for a \nshift is to be set up.  \n\uf0b7 Be cert ain you have plenty of change in the till. Taking time in the middle of a \nbusy shift is not good. You have numerous other responsibilities you have to be \nlooking after.  \n \nThe HOW\u2019s  \n \nRemember your restaurants success depends on the HOW\u2019S  \nHOW fresh are your  products?  \nHOW clean is your restaurant?  \nHOW great is the service?  \n \nAt $3000 worth of sales that equals about 400 guests dining at Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s a \nday. That is 400+ people talking about HOW great or HOW bad a dining experience they \nhad.  \n \nThat\u2019s a lot of word of mouth floating around a community.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 105 \n \nLabor Scheduling  \n \nThe Work Schedule is a most valuable tool available to you.  If it is used properly, your \nrestaurant will run well, stay clean and maintain controls.  The schedule is your overall \nplan for each day, week and month.  Labor hours are both an expense and a resource.  By \nhaving the right people working at the right time you maximize sales and deliver the best \ncustomer experience while staying on budget.  \n \nThere are several tools that you need to build a Work Schedule:  \n \n\uf0b7 Availability Worksheet:  this is your list of employees with the days and hours \nthey are available and the lists the positions they can work.  \n\uf0b7 Hourly Sales Guide:  projecting sales is the foundation of making a sched ule.  The \nHourly Sales Guide provides the historical sales to help you project the current \nweek\u2019s sales.  \n\uf0b7 Promotion Schedule/Calendar:  planning for coupons drops, product promotions, \nand school nights allows you to have the staff on hand for potential sale s increases \nper day and per shift.  \n\uf0b7 Labor Productivity Chart:  this chart gives you the information to determine the \nnumber of staff needed per sales hour taking into account the experience of your \nstaff.  \n \nBefore you start to make out a schedule, be sure yo u have the tools you need have been \nupdated with current information:  \n \n \u2022     The most recent Hourly Sales Guide  \n \u2022     Employee Availability Form  \n \u2022     Employee requests for days off  \n\u2022 Promotion schedule  \n\u2022 Last week's Work Schedule  \n \nBe sure you choose a quiet place to do the schedule where you will not be interrupted.  \nGive yourself at least 1 to 2 hours to complete it.  Before starting review the following:  \n \n1.  Sales Projections are the most important part of scheduling since they provide \nthe basis for all other computations.  \na. Use Hourly Sales Guide to compute the average of last 2 -3 similar \nweeks  \nb. Adjust for promotions or LSM efforts.  \nc. Revise for local events such as parades, concerts, or ball games.  Look \nat the Hourly Sales  Guide for previous year sales on the event dates.   \nd. Review previous week's schedule for observations that apply to current \nweek.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 106 \n \n2.  Do Sales projections by hour for each day of the week.  \n \n3.  Determine number of people needed per hour.  \n \nOnce you have  determined the hour's sales, determine the number of \npeople needed using the Labor Productivity Chart.  Consider which part of \nthe hour has the most sales to determine if people should be brought in on \nthe 1/2 hour.  Consider your team's experience level and position \nknowledge when scheduling.  \n \n4.  Schedule Management shifts.  \n \nMake sure a Management person (including Shift Manager) is responsible \nfor each shift. Keep the Management overlap to as little as possible.  The \nmanager should always be in the rest aurant during the busiest times and \nshould work some weekends and nights.  Schedule time for management \nresponsibilities.  \n \n5.  Add hours for all additional jobs.   \n a. Opening  \n b. Set -up prep       \nc. Closing     \n d. Orientation/Training  \n \n6.  Add hours for special events and LSM activities.  \n  \n7.  Double check that you are within the labor standard for the week.  \n \nCalculate the hours you project to use based on the projected sales \nvolume.  Look carefully over your projections and your numbers of people \nto catc h any weak spots or errors.  \n \nThe minimum coverage for lunch is four people between 11:30 am and 2 \npm and three people at minimum during all other hours of operation.  It is \nhighly recommended to have four people on staff from 5 pm to 8:30 pm.  \n \n8.  Invest a dditional hours to build the business.  \n a. Lunch  \n b. Dinner  \n \nIf you have scheduled to beat the standard for the week, look for places to invest \nadditional hours to build the business.   \n \n9.  Write in names.   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 107 \n \n  \nWhen figuring your team's placement on the sche dule, consider \npersonalities that work together well.  Also schedule your inexperienced \nstaff with the more experienced.   Once the names and positions are filled \nin, schedule a break for each person working over a 5 hour shift; make \nsure the area is cover ed.  Always make time for training and cross \ntraining. If you have staff that worked a fixed weekly schedule, put them \non the schedule first.  \n \n10.  Schedule breaks.  \n \nAlways schedule breaks along non -peak hours.  Block that person off the \nschedule and make  sure they're covered.  \n \n11.  Review training needs/goals and revise shifts as needed to have experts \nworking when training will take place.  \n \nSchedule trainees with strong employees that can pick up the slack for a \nnew person.  The restaurant manager should  always work with new people \non their first day.  \n \n12.  Post by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.  \n \nThe schedule is a management tool.  If sales are consistently down, you will need to \nadjust the rest of the week's sales in addition to the labor and product needs.  Nev er wait \nuntil Sunday to adjust for the week's low sales.  Let the schedule help you by marking \nspecial situations.  Also, mark on the schedule communications or motivations; you'll be \nsurprised how many of your staff will read it.  \n \nAvailability Worksheet  \nThe Availability Worksheet is used as a reference for scheduling and hiring needs.  It is a \nrecord for when employees are available to work throughout the week as well as in what \npositions they are proficient.  \n \nHow to use:  \n  \n 1.  List employee name and pho ne number under the appropriate day/part.  \n 2.  Mark the days of the week the employee can work.  \n 3.  Rank the positions in which the employee can work.  \n 4.  Keep this chart with you when completing the schedule.  \n 5.  Write in employee's age if under 18.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 108 \n \nThe Availability Worksheet can be an invaluable tool for scheduling and covering \npositions during sickness or employee shortages.  \n \n \nManager Schedule  \n \nPrepare a monthly manager schedule and post it the week before the preceding month.  \nThe manager schedule must take into account management responsibilities and upcoming \nevents including:  Local Store Marketing, holidays, days off and meetings.  Completing a \nmonthly schedule for managers allows them to better balance their work and personal \nlives.  It insures that critical manager tasks are planned for and completed on time.  The \nmanager should work mostly mid shifts, working lunch through the busiest part of dinner.  \nThe assistant manager should work the busy day parts with open or close shifts.  The \nassistant  manager covers the mid shifts when the manager is not working.  Crew leaders \ncover the less busy closing and opening shifts.  \n \n \nShift Position Chart  \nThe shift position chart is a tool designed to be used by the manager on duty. The purpose \nof the chart is to ensure the manager on duty is positioning employees according to \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s deployment standards. Additionally, each position should be filled \nby a well -trained employee, ensuring we have our \u201caces in their places.\u201d Proper staffing, \ntraining, scheduling and positioning are all key components to be rush -ready and provide \nevery customer a great Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s experience.  \n \nThe shift position chart should be laminated and posted in area of the store visible to team \nmembers and out of view to customers. The manager on duty is responsible for filling in \nthe blanks before opening for lunch and after shift change for dinner. (Tip: Use a dry \nerase marker for easy marking and clean -up) \n \nThe shift position chart was designed to work in sync with the Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nlabor scheduling tools.  \n \nIn order for the position chart to be an effective tool for the manager on duty, the back -up \nwork must be done to ensure accurate schedules are created by using accurate and current \nsales.  \n \nAnytime the manager  assumes responsibility for a shift, one of the key responsibilities is \nto verify staff coverage for the shift. The first step is to review the schedule to be sure no \none will be running late to work, manager simply fills in the laminated position chart.  \n \nBy making the position chart part of the manager\u2019s daily routine, it forces them to \nconsider his or her team, and to place team members in positions that will ensure the best \nexperience for Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s customers. Additionally, fellow employees wil l  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 109 \n \ngrow accustomed to checking the chart as soon as they clock -in to begin work \nimmediately. By highlighting shift priorities and other team member\u2019s shifts, everyone \nwill be aware of in and out times and how they can support one another to make it a \nproduc tive workday.  Having the shift huddle for each shift in front of the position chart \nwill reinforce the manager\u2019s communication.  \n \nLabor Productivity Chart  \n \nIn order to figure the number of staff required per sales hours, you need the Labor \nProductivity Chart.  The chart gives you the information to layout.  \n \nOpening and Closing Labor Hours  \n \nOpening and closing hours are determined by the size of the restaurant, sales volume and \npre-closing hourly sales.  The size of the restaurant impacts closing hours, t he bigger the \ndining room/kitchen area the longer it can take to close.  Another impact on closing hours \nis the sales volume of the hours just before close.  Higher sales volumes make reduce the \namount of pre -closing that can be done, therefore increasing work to be done at close.  \nLastly sales volume impacts the morning prep need to get the restaurant ready to open.   \n \nAs a starting point, it is recommended to schedule 4 to 5 hours for opening and 4 hours \nfor closing.  The 5 hours for opening includes:  \n1. Two employees arrive at 9 a.m.  \n2. The third employee arrives at 10 a.m.  This should be the restaurant manager \nor shift leader.  \n3. The opening checklist is completed with the restaurant ready to open at 10:45 \na.m.  \n \nThe 4 hours for closing includes:  \n1. Three closers a nd the shift leader/manager comprise the closing crew.   \n2. The closers are assigned to each of the closing zones:  dining room, service \narea, grill area, and kitchen.   \n3. Each closer completes their zone checklist and helps others complete closing \ntheir areas.    \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 110 \n \n \n \nPosition Validation: Dish/Prep        \n \nInitial to indicate you have demonstrated competence in following areas:  \n \n \nMIT  \n \n____  Read the primary and secondary duties and follows proper practices  \n____  Adheres to critical success factors   \n____  Read the 3S\u2019s section of the Operations Manual  \n____  Demonstrated knowledge of the following Dish duties  \no 3 compartment sink standards with proper chemical levels  \no Sanitation usage of sanitizer buckets  \no Back of the house FIFO of dry storage  \no Walk -in cooler organized to  health department code  \no Security of back door locked at all times  \no Assist service Team Member  \no Completion of prep sheet/prepping of product to recipe adherence  \n____  Properly used cutlery and cutting boards  \n \n \n___________________________   _____________________ _________  \nManager -In-Training     Certified Trainer   Date  \n \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 -

Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s was born of Bob and Richard\u2019s passion for \ngiving their Guests the freshest, best -tasting food, great service and outstanding value  in \na place they\u2019re proud to bring their families.  \n \nThe first Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s opened in Hiram, G eorgia in August, 2007 and became \nan overnight success. Guests couldn\u2019t get enough of our gourmet, hand -pattied burgers. \nWe grill them to perfection and Guests top them any way they like at Bobby\u2019s \u201cBuild \nYour Own Burger Bar.\u201d Guests also love our fresh Fr ench fries, which we slice twice \ndaily in our kitchen, our sizzling hotdogs and tasty chicken, and our old -fashioned \nCustard desserts.  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s burger was voted the Best Hamburger in Hiram in 2008, and \nsuddenly it seemed as if every town want ed its own Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Restaurant. \nThe formula for success caught on, and Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s was soon opening \ncorporate stores and franchised units.  \n \nRichard and Bob have extensive restaurant experience, a knack for carving a niche in the \n\u201cQuic k Casual\u201d dining segment and a shared passion for excellence.

There must never be a dark build up on \nthe grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nEvery week use the flat to p thermometer to calibrate the temperature of the flat tops. This \nprocess will ensure the flat top is cooking even throughout the grill.  \n \nTurn the grill on at 9:00 AM to get ready to begin the day\u2019s cooking process.  \n \n \nGrill Calibration:  Thermostat Adjustment Procedure  \n \nEach week the grill surface temperature is to be checked to insure that the grill temperatures are \ncorrect.  Initially the temperature was adjusted at the factory. However, if the grill surface \ntemperature varies greatly from the sett ing on the thermostat knob adjust the thermostat using the \nfollowing procedure:  \n \n1. Turn all the control knobs to the 350\u00b0F setting.  \n2. Wait 30 minutes (or 1 hour if grill was cold) for surface to stabilize.  \n3. Place a thermocouple with surface temperature probe ha lfway back from the front to the \nback of the grill plate and directly over a burner set (in line with a burner control knob).  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  7 \n \nCheck the temperature over each burner set every 5 minutes until the temperature over \neach burner set stabilizes and does not chan ge by more than 30\u00b0F between two \nconsecutive measurements.  \n4. If the average temperature over any burner set is not within 30\u00b0F of the knob setting \n(350\u00b0F), adjust the corresponding thermostat by removing the knob, holding the \nthermostat stem (do not allow st em to turn or temperature setting will be changed) and \nturning the small screw located within the base of the stem. Turn this screw counter \nclockwise to increase the temperature, clockwise to decrease the temperature.  \n \n \nGrill Cooler  \n \nIt is the responsibili ty of the cook to maintain the proper ingredient inventory in the grill \ndrawers. The grill cook must constantly be aware of the temperature of products in the grill \ndrawers. Refrigerated products require a temperature of 40 degrees F or less to assure a \ntemperature that does not promote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nMaintain a minimum of a two hour inventory of product in the grill cooler to include:  \n\uf0b7 4.7 ounce hamburger portions  \n\uf0b7 Chicken breasts  \n\uf0b7 6 to 1 and 8 to 1 Hot dogs  \n\uf0b7 Turkey patties  \n\uf0b7 Veggie patties  \n\uf0b7 American, cheddar, Swiss, Bleu, and shredded cheddar cheese  \n\uf0b7 Saut\u00e9ed onions  \n \nTwice a day check the temperature of product in the grill drawers to insure products are \nmaintained between 34 and 40 degrees.  Temperature checks are  made at 10 am and 4 pm.  \nRefrigerated products require a temperature of 40\u00b0 F or less to assure a temperature that does not \npromote bacterial growth and to meet Health Department regulations.  \n \nBreak Down of the Grill Cooler  \n \n\uf0b7 At closing each night, the ent ire grill cooler and bun flat tops area must be thoroughly \ncleaned and sanitized. Use the current grill cleaning method to ensure the best result.  \n\uf0b7 Pull out all products and wrap with plastic wrap.  Make sure to date each item.  \n\uf0b7 Manager must be notified of a ny item which appears to be of inferior quality or is out of \nshelf life.  Items can only be discarded with manager\u2019s permission.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  8 \n \n \nMeat Grill Setup  \n \nIt will take 15 minutes for the grill to warm up to the correct temperature. Season the grill with \noil from the fryer before cooking.  The temperature of the burger and bun grills is set to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Burger grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n\uf0b7 Bun grill set at 350\u00b0 F.  \n \nSmall equ ipment required:  \n\uf0b7 One meat spatula  \n\uf0b7 One poultry spatula  \n\uf0b7 Grill scraper  \n\uf0b7 Grill squeegee/scraper  \n\uf0b7 One spatula for veggie burger/grilled cheese  \n\uf0b7 Red, yellow and black tongs  \n\uf0b7 Digital thermometer  \n\uf0b7 Six dome lids  \n \nOther items required:  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with water  \n\uf0b7 Squeeze bottle with liquid margarine  \n\uf0b7 Burger seasoning in stainless shaker  \n\uf0b7 Small bucket with a clean towel and sanitizer solution  \n\uf0b7 Roller and with liquid margarine for buns  \n \nDuring the shift the grill is cleaned and maintained to minimize build -up of carbon on the \nsurface. There must never be a dark build up on the grill for an extended amount of time.  \n \nGrease tub :   The grease tub is designed to contain grease run off from the grill surface. The \ngrease tub must never be allowed to overfill.  Empty the grease tub tw ice daily and dispose of the \ngrease properly.  \n \n \nBurger Cooking Procedure  \n \nProper cooking and seasoning of burgers is paramount to making a great burger.  Always place \nthe burger at the beginning of the grill that is designated for the first stage of the co oking \nprocess.  Placement of the burgers is important in maximizing the space on the grill and tracking \nthe cooking process.  All burgers are cooked to medium well.  On request burgers can be cooked \nto well done only.  Burgers cannot be cooked less than me dium well.  \n.   \n \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  9 \n \n1. Using the meat tongs, place the burger meat on the grill three burgers\u2019 distance (14 \ninches) from the side of the grill.  The side of the grill is determined by the product flow \nto the expo station.  \n2. Press burger using steak weight into a 5 in ch patty.  \n3. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  Move burger using spatula.  \n4. Cook for 2 minutes 30 seconds and flip the burger.  \n5. Lightly sprinkle entire burger with burger seasoning.  \n6. Check burger doneness in 2 minutes 30 seconds.  To check that the hamburgers are \ncooked throughout, place a small nick in the center of the burger. If the juice comes out \nclear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be cooked a little more.  The internal temperature \nmust reach at least 160\u00b0 to 165\u00b0 F.  \n7. Dredge burg er through accumulated burger fat on the grill.  \n8. Put cheese on burgers immediately if requested and cover with dome.  Pull burgers \nwithout cheese off the grill.  \n9. Allow cheese to partially melt (10 to 15 seconds) and remove burger from grill.  \nAmerican cheese  takes 10 seconds and the other cheeses take 15 seconds.  \n \nCritical Success Factors  \n \n\uf0b7 Use the burger seasoning mix on both sides of the burger.  \n\uf0b7 Do not over season product (use correct seasoning distribution container).  \n\uf0b7 Do not allow the cheese to over melt.  \n\uf0b7 To check that the hamburgers are cooked throughout, place a small nick in the center \nof the burger. If the juice comes out clear it is cooked. If it is bloody it must be \ncooked a little more. The temperature must be 160 to 165 degrees.  \n\uf0b7 It is important to properly forecast the flow of burgers to be placed on the grill based \nupon:  \n1.

Word of mouth is our life blood to success.

This task is not easy, but it can be done. The most effective method is a \nthree -staged attack:  \n \n1. Protect food against contamination between the temperatures 41\u00b0 -140\u00b0, the danger \nzone.  \n2. Reduce the effect of contamination that does occur.  \n3. Ensure all Team Members are well versed in sanitation procedures.  \n \nThe definition of sanitized is the reduction of h armful bacteria to a safe level.  \n \nTwo common causes of food borne illness:  \n1. Cross Contamination.                                    \n2. Food remaining in the danger zone too long.  \n \nTwo ways to avoid cross -contamination:  \n1. Ensure proper hand washing with soap and hot water for 20 seconds and rinse.  \n2. Use proper color coded cutting boards and use proper utensils.  \n \nFood contamination may occur from any of three hazards:  \n \n1. Biological  - Bacterial contamination. This is controlled by practicing safe food \nhandling and stora ge procedures.  \n2. Chemical  - Contamination of foods with pesticides, use of excessive additives, and \ncontamination of food with toxic metals. Proper storage of chemicals and equipment \nand use of proper storage containers control this.  \n3. Physical  - Contamination  of foods with broken glass, metal fragments, etc. This can \nbe controlled by good facilities maintenance, planning, and training Team Members \nin safe operating procedures.  \n \nFood Poisoning  \n \nThe fear of food poisoning is always present in every restaurant.  Years of effort in \nbuilding a great food service reputation can be destroyed, virtually overnight, if an \noutbreak occurs in an establishment.  Food poisoning occurs in two ways:  \n \n1. A food -borne infection (disease which occurs from eating food which contains  a \nharmful micro -organism)  \n2. A food -borne intoxication (when poisons or toxins in the food cause illness in the \nbody.)  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  43 \n \nFood Handling  \n \nIt is of the utmost importance that food is handled with the greatest care to prevent the \nspread of any bacteria that may cause food poisoning.  \n \nBacterial reaction creates what is called a TOXIN.  Toxins that are produced by bacteria \nare poisonous in the finished cooked product.  Sometimes, although we think that we \nhave taken adequate care of our products; bacterial acti ons in these products are such that \nthe toxins produced will remain poisonous.  \n \nWatchwords in the food service industry are KEEP IT HOT, OR KEEP IT COLD, or \nDON\u2019T USE IT.  All products must remain heated or refrigerated to maintain a product \ntemperature wi thin the food safeness range: Do not hold at room temperature!  \n \nRefrigerate to: 40\u00b0 F or below  \nHeat to: 140\u00b0 F or above  \n \nPotential Food Safeness Problem Areas in a Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s:  \nThe manager must inform Team Members to notify him/her if any of the f ollowing \nprocedures have occurred:  \n \n1. Containers of prepared foods not labeled with date and time.  \n2. Canned products that are swollen.  \n3. Any bone chips in the burgers.  \n4. Chicken that is not rotated and has a foul odor.  \n5. A foul odor when a can is opened or if the p roduct appears to be unusually thinned.  \nDO NOT TASTE THE PRODUCT. It is probably unsafe. Contaminated food could \ncause you to become extremely ill.  \n6. Have sanitizer buckets at all appropriate stations. Buckets must be changed every half \nhour or as needed.  \n7. Product left in opened can and put back in the cooler. No canned product must ever \nbe stored in the original container once it has been opened.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  44 \n \nWalk -In Cooler  \n \nFungus, mold, or spoilage may occur on the outside surface of some items in the walk -in \ncooler.  In the walk -in cooler, warm air rises and condensation falls.  All bacterial growth \nrequires warmth and moisture.  When the door of the cooler is opened warm a ir from the \noutside rushes into the cooler.  This causes condensation on the food products stored on \nthe lower shelves or floor.  The moisture contacting the meat or produce can cause a \nslimy surface. Temperature of the cooler and cold units must be 40\u00b0 or  less.  \n \n1. Items stored on lower shelves of the walk -in cooler must be products that cannot be \ncontaminated through condensation.   \n2. The middle shelves have the greatest air circulation.  \n3. The top shelves must be used to store perishable items such as lettuce,  tomatoes, and \nother perishables that require a colder temperature.  \n4. Follow food hierarchy with all products in cooler.  \n \nNo matter how well the refrigeration unit is cleaned and sanitized, if fungus or mold \nspores contaminate the refrigeration unit, they ca n reproduce and contaminate the entire \ncooler area.  Although the cooler may be clean one day, if the fan, drip pan, and \nrefrigeration unit are not cleaned as well, the entire cooler area can be re -contaminated.  \nTherefore, when the walk -in units are clean ed, also clean the pans, the fan blades, the \nunits themselves, and the top of the refrigeration units . \n \nGrill Table Sanitation  \n \n1. All products must be stored in proper containers to prevent meat juices from dripping \ninto the other product.  \n2. The drawers must remain closed when not in use.  \n3. The internal temperature of the product in the grill table cooler inserts must be \nchecked periodically during the day using a probe thermometer to ensure all \ningredients are refrigerated to 40\u00ba F or below.   \n4. Product should nev er be left in the grill coolers overnight. All products should be \nremoved and taken to the walk -in cooler for storage.  \n5. To avoid cross contamination the cook must never handle raw meat and then touch \nthe cheese going on top of the burger.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  45 \n \nStorage  \n \nAll stoc k must be stored in the designated storage areas immediately after it has been \ndated and rotated.  Dry groceries, canned goods, and paper products must be placed in \ndry storage.  Perishable foods must be refrigerated or frozen immediately.  \n \nStorage and Rot ation  \n \n1. Label all products immediately upon delivery to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) \nrotation procedures are followed.  \n2. All perishable foods must be refrigerated immediately upon delivery.  \n3. To ensure a food safe product temperature, equip all refrigeration units with \nthermometers and check at each shift change.   \nWalk -in cooler, salad bar and coolers:  36 - 40\u00b0 F  \nFreezers: 0 -10\u00b0 F  \n4. Properly store food items in the walk -in cooler and freezer to minimize \ncontamination.  To prevent spoilage and to ensure proper rotation, do not place new \nproduct directly on top of the previously thawed products.  \n5. Know and follow all shelf life guidelines.  Any product that is not used before its \nexpiration date must  be discarded.  \n6. Do not store containers directly on the floor.  Items must be stored at least 6\u201d off the \nfloor for sanitation purposes.  Check with your local Health Department for \nrequirements.  \n7. In storing foods, permit free circulation of cool air on all s urfaces.  \n8. Check all food items daily for spoilage.  \n \nDry Storage  \n \n1. Dry storage items must be kept in a cool, dry (70 -80\u00b0 F) area to prevent spoilage and \nswelling of canned goods.  \n2. Dry storage areas must be kept clean and free of rodents and insects.  This means that \nall walls, ceilings, and floor openings must be sealed or otherwise protected.  \n3. All products must be arranged to ensure the First In / First Out (FIFO) rotation \nprocedures are followed.  Arrangement of shelves must be in accordance with that of \nthe inventory worksheet.  \n \nFood Handling Guidelines  \n \nThe best way to control the spread of bacteria is:  \n \n1. Cleanliness of food handlers - Hand washing -Glove usage  \n2. Proper sanitation in the kitchen.  \n3. Minimize exposure of opened or prepared foods to room temperatu re. \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  46 \n \n \nTeam Member Sanitation Guidelines  \n \n1. Practice good personal hygiene habits. WASH HANDS with soap and water for a \nminimum of 20 seconds  before and after handling food, going to  the restroom, using \ncleaning or other chemicals, smoking, handling money, handling raw meats, coughing \nor sneezing, picking up items off the floor, touching your hair, face, or other parts of \nyour body.  Restrooms must have a sign posted reminding Team Members to wash \ntheir hands.  \n2. Never let food come in contact with sores or cuts. Team Members must use proper \ncolored bandages and finger cots.  \n3. Properly refrigerate food to 40\u00b0 F or below; thoroughly heat or cook food to 140\u00b0 F or \nabove to ensure food remains within the food safeness range.  \n4. Prepare only one day\u2019s anticipated usag e of any food item according to the Manager \u2019s \nPreparation List.  \n5. DO NOT add raw ingredients to foods that receive no further cooking.  \n6. DO NOT cross -contaminate different types of foods. This usually happens through \nmishandling or misuse of common cooking ut ensils or equipment.  \n7. DO NOT refreeze any product, which has previously thawed.  \n8. All food contact surfaces must be cleaned after every use with a clean, hot towel and \nan approved sanitized rinse (such as bleach/water solution).  \n9. Wear proper hair restraints to  meet Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s  standards  and Health \nDepartment regulations to prevent contaminating food with hair.  \n10. Investigate suspected contamination for determination of food safeness: suspect \nproducts must be discarded.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  47 \n \nKeys To Prevent Guests Getting Food -Borne Illness:  \n \n\uf0b7 Use sanitizer to clean all areas. Towels must be in hand or sanitizer bucket.  \n\uf0b7 Rotate sanitizer buckets a minimum of every 30 minutes or as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Keep raw and cooked food out of danger zone at all times.  \n\uf0b7 Team Members consistently wash  their hands for at least 20 seconds.  \n\uf0b7 Check product temperatures every hour on the hour.  \n\uf0b7 Thoroughly complete  Open -Mid-Close checklists.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all OMC checklists for documentation purposes.  \n\uf0b7 Constantly changing out gloves.  \n\uf0b7 While running the 8 steps look to en sure compliance of food handling.  \n\uf0b7 Aprons are changed as needed.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your thermometer is calibrated.  \n\uf0b7 Use tongs to handle chicken.  \n\uf0b7 Use proper color cutting boards  \n\uf0b7 With any Guest issues follow risk management procedures 100% and inform the \nunits GM.  \n\uf0b7 When inspections are done by health department shadow the inspector and make \nimmediate impact on any violations. SHOW A SENSE OF URGENY.  \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  48 \n \nJOB SAFETY  \n \nThe goal of every safety and health program is to provide a safe workplace and to \nprevent:  \n1. Accidents.  \n2. Injury.  \n3. Job-related illness.  \n \nManagers want to prevent accidents realizing that accident prevention and efficient \nproduction go together.  Managers must take the necessary steps to ensure that their \nTeam Members have a safe place to work and that they foll ow work safety procedures.  \n \nMajor concerns in accident prevention are:  \n \n1. Making the workplace as safe as possible.  \n2. Controlling Team Member action.  \n \nMost accidents are caused by inappropriate behavior on the part of the Team Member, \nrather than uncontrollable physical conditions.  Accidents  usually occur because a Team \nMember acted improperly or was in violation of Company safety rules or its policies.  \n \nTo make Team Members truly safety -conscious, the manager must:  \n \n1. Make Team Members aware  of safety.  \n2. Reinforce the concept in face -to-face relationships with Team Members.  \n \nSafety responsibilities of management:  \n \n1. Develop, maintain, teach, and enforce safety  procedures consistently every day.  \n2. Identification of possible hazardous areas.  \n3. Keeping the workplace and machinery in safe condition.  \n4. Establishing and enforcing safe work methods for Team Members.  \n5. Instructing Team Members in safe job performance.  \n6. Follow -up to ensure Team Members continue to meet safety requirements.  \n7. Providing a good example of safe working habits.  \n8. Understanding in dealing with Team Members who are unresponsive to safety \npractices.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  49 \n \nTo minimize the adverse effects of accidents and prevent their recurrence you must:  \n \n1. Maintain all required first aid items in first aid kit . \n2. Display emergency procedures  including emergency phone numbers for police, \nparamedics and fire departments.  \n3. Train Team Members to:  \na. Follow emergency procedures.  \nb. Prom ptly report every accident.  \n4. Gather, analyze, and report information regarding an accident.  \n5. Take action  on the results of an accident investigation to prevent recurrence  of a \nsimilar accident.  \n6. Maintain a working environment that has no safety or health haza rds. \n7. Communicate  with employees in a manner that minimizes episodes of highly \nemotional behavior that often results in accidents.  \n \nEach manager must establish additional Team Member safety training .  Films are \navailable from your local fire department.  \n \nCostly Injuries:  \n \nThe primary accidents within our industry are:  \n \n1. Injuries that occur due to improper lifting procedures.  These injuries are normally the \nMOST COSTLY in work -time loss, medical treatment and claims.  \n2. Injuries due to a slip or fall on a wet floor.  \n3. Injuries by cuts, i.e., punctures, scrapes, lacerations.  \n4. Injuries by burns due to scalding or heat/cold exposure.  \n \nThese accidents result in:  \n \n1. Time lost by injured Team Member.  \n2. Lost time by fellow Team Members who stop to aid an injured co -worker or  those \nwho stop out of curiosity.  \n3. Lost production.  \n4. Spoilage or damage to inventory.  \n5. Property damage.  \n6. Hiring and training of a replacement Team Member.  \n7. Resulting loss of business.  \n8. Valuable time spent by company Management investigating cause of accident.  \n9. Unfavorable publicity.  \n10. Lowered Team Member morale.  \n11. Unfavorable impact on bottom line profit.  \n12. Personal discomfort and inconvenience to the injured Team Member.  \n  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  50 \n \nDo it the Safe Way  \n \nHere are some pointers management can use at a safety training session for food service \nTeam Members concerning the four most prevalent types of accidents that occur in food \nservice operations.  \n \nStrains due to improper lifting  \n \n1. Lift trays or any object, using the leg muscle, not your back.  (See lifting procedures ) \n \nFalls  \n1. Keep fl oors clean; wipe up spilled foods, grease, etc.  immediately . \n2. Keep floors and aisles clear of obstructions.  \n3. Do not  stand on boxes, tables, or chairs to reach objects.  Use proper size ladder or \nstep stool .  Do not overreach . \n4. When carrying anything, do not allow your view to become blocked.  \n \nCuts  \n1. Use knives properly ; keep them sharp.  \n2. If a knife falls, do not  try to catch it.  Let it fall . \n3. Use care in removing broken glass.  Don\u2019t pick it up \u2014sweep it up! Remove  slivers \nwith dampened paper.  \n4. Never hand -feed slicing machines.  \n5. Use cut gloves at all times.  \n \nBurns  \n1. Assume that every pot or steam table pan is hot. \n2. Keep handles turned  inward . \n3. Open hot water or other hot liquid faucets slowly to avoid splashes . \n4. Tip pot covers toward you  to release steam in opposite d irection . \n5. Get assistance  where necessary to handle heavy, hot utensils . \n \nLifting Procedures  \n \nChin UP!  This automatically puts the back into a position ready for lifting.  \n \nFeet \n \nPlace feet about as far apart as the width of your musters with one foot a little ahead of \nthe other.  Stand directly facing the object  to be lifted, and as close to the object as \npossible.  \n \nThe farther away from the load you stand, the more strain it puts on your back.   For \nexample, assume the weight of the load is 20 pounds and you have to stand three feet  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  51 \n \naway in order to lift it.  The strain of lifting it is equal to the weight of the load times the \ndistance, or 20 lbs. x 3 ft = 60 lbs.  Not an easy lift anymore is it?  \n \nKnees  \n \nBend your knees  to help you straddle the load and develop leverage  as you pick it up or \nput it down.  In the bent position, get as close to the load  as possible.  \n \nBack  \n \nThe back actually must be referred to as the spinal column and back muscles.  The spinal \ncolumn is mad e up of bones; the cushiony, spongy discs between the bones; the \nligaments; and the muscles that hold the bones upright and together.  \n \nWhen your spinal column is held correctly,  it can support a substantial amount of weight; \nalthough when you bend or twist  your spinal column to lift something, the bones are \n\u201ctilted\u201d and unable to bear as great a load.  Twisting the body  in order to pick up or put \ndown a load can lead to back injury .   Remember to lift the object gradually .  Jerky lifting \nmotions  can put a s udden strain on the spinal column or muscles and cause injury . \n \nHands and Fingers  \n \nProperly gripping the object to be lifted is very important.  Use one hand underneath to \nsupport the load.  Place the other across the top and grip the far edge.  Avoid gett ing your \nfingers pinched when you put down the object by setting one corner down first.  While \ncarrying a carton, DO NOT attempt to ADJUST YOUR GRIP WHILE IN MOTION.  \nSTOP, REST it on a support, and THEN make the change.  \n \nStomach  \n \nAbdominal  as well as back  muscles play a part in lifting.  Too heavy a load or sudden \ntwists can cause a strain in the abdominal muscles.  \n \nIf the load is too heavy, get help ; either a material moving device such as hand truck or \nforklift, or another person.  Two or more people lif ting a load requires  teamwork .  If one \nperson on the \u201cteam\u201d lifts too soon, shifts the load, or lowers the load improperly , either \nperson may be overloaded or overstrained.  It is wiser to decide in advance who will give \nthe orders to coordinate all the moves.  Once the order is given, don\u2019t change your mind \nat the last second to get a better grip or shift your position!  This has been the cause of \nmany accidents.  \n \nWhen carrying objects, many people rest the object against their stomachs to lighten the \nload.  In doing this, they will be leaning backward causing the spinal column to be bent, \nthus putting unnecessary stress on both their muscles and spine.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  52 \n \nEyes  \n \nDon\u2019t allow the load you\u2019re carrying to block your vision causing you to trip over unseen \nobjects . \n \nThe answer to all the following questions must be \u201cyes\u201d prior to lifting and carrying a \nheavy or bulky load:  \n \n1. Is the route to be taken clear and properly illuminated both upstairs and downstairs?  \n2. Is the object free of nails, sharp corners, loose metal straps or splinters?  \n3. Am I wearing the protective equipment to handle it safely, i.e. gloves, apron, goggles \nor foot protection?  \n4. Am I remembering to place the short object on top of the long, and the narrow on top \nof the wide?  \n \nSummation  \n \nThe lifting position for each person will vary slightly depending on their height and \nweight.  The key points to remember are:  \n \n1. Check the planned route.  Decide on how to best grasp the object and make sure the \nload is easily within your lifting capacity.  \n2. Position fee t and squat close to the load.  \n3. Get a good grip and lift gradually using your leg muscles as much as possible and the \nleverage created by your bent knee.  Keep the load close to the body.  \n4. Make sure the object is close to you when lifting and keep it close w hen carrying.  \nMake sure you can see where you are going.  \n \nReceiving and Storing  \n \n1. When opening boxes, crates, etc, use the proper tool designed for removing nails, \nwire, or sharp metal bands.  Remove these objects and discard immediately.  \n2. Store heavy material on bottom shelves, medium weight on the next shelves, \nlightweight and breakables on top.  \n3. Keep food containers covered in refrigerators when not in use.  \n4. When opening edibles, examine for possible foreign matter.  \n5. In handling boxes, crates, or any fo od material follow rules for safe lifting.  Use \nladders to reach for anything too high for you.  Do not stand on crates, boxes, or \ntrashcans.  \n6. Use handles to open and close drawers.  \n7. Store all insecticides, pesticides, disinfectants, and washing compounds in  areas away \nfrom food or food -handling areas.  Do not store on shelves above food preparation or \nfood-handling areas.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  53 \n \n8. All walk -in boxes must have a bump handle release.  When coming out of a walk -in \nbox, open door gradually.  \n \nThe Kitchen  \n \n1. Grills, fryers, blenders, freezers, and slicers can all cause accidents if mishandled.  \n2. Never allow any machine to be used unless the Team Member has been trained to use \nit properly.  Make certain that all safety devices are in place before using.  \n3. Do not wear loose clothin g (open shirt, sleeves, neckties, apron strings) or jewelry \naround any machinery or equipment.  \n4. Pull plug on any piece of equipment that is not direct -wired or throw breaker on any \ndirect -wired piece of machinery before cleaning or adjusting any machine.  \n5. Keep fingers, hands, knives or spoons away from moving parts.  \n6. Keep fingers, hands and arms out of all equipment.  \n7. All electrical kitchen equipment must be grounded.  \nKnives  \n \n1. The sharper the knife, the less chance of injury.  It cuts more easily, takes less \npressure, and has less chance of slipping.  \n2. Pick knives up by the handle, never by the blade.  Put them away in racks when not in \nuse.  Never cover them with a cloth, even tempo rarily; you may forget they are there.  \n3. In handling knives:  \na. Cut away from your body or hand.  \nb. Use cut glove at all times  \nc. When drying a knife, keep the sharp edge away from you.  \nd. Never leave knives in the sink or water, or where they cannot be easily seen.  \ne. Properly dispose of all knives that are worn, broken, or have loose handles.  \n4. Do not put dirty knives into a tub of soapy water where it cannot be seen.  \nSomeone may reach in and cut themselves.  \nFloors  \n \n1. Spilled liquids, grease and food cause most slips and fal ls in the kitchen area.  \n2. Keep floors clean and dry.  \n3. If you spill it \u2013 wipe it up immediately!  \n4. If you drop it \u2013 pick it up immediately!  \n5. Tile floors may be slippery when the weather is humid.  Take special care to avoid \nslips and falls.  Wipe tile floors periodically when weather is humid.  \n6. Shoes - wear proper shoes such as rubber or crepe soles (must say non -slip on the \nbox) to avoid slips and falls.  \n7. Walk; do not run across the floor.  \n8. Keep floor clear of utensils, boxes, or pieces of food.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  54 \n \nTrash disposal  \n \n1. Do not let containers overflow.  \n2. Keep garbage can lids on tightly.  \n3. If plastic disposal bags are used, be sure that they are tied securely.  \n4. All lids from can must be put back into the can or in a box so when you compact \ngarbage with your hand you do not cut yourself.  \n \nDining Room Area  \n \n1. Subdued lighting must never be so dim that movement required for serving is unsafe.  \n2. A routine inspection conducted at least once a day must be established to inspect \nchairs, stools, counters, and tables for broken parts, splint ers, and loose joints. If such \nfaulty items are found, they must be removed from the area and repaired or replaced.  \nHygiene and Sanitation  \n \nIn eight hours, one bacteria cell, under certain conditions, can multiply into a family of \nover thirty -five trillion, causing food poisoning to your customers.  \nThis is an extremely threatening condition for a business.  There are two things that must \nbe done to control bacteria and prevent hazardous conditions.  \n \n1. Insist Team Members follow good personal hygien e and sanitation procedures.  \n2. Keep food refrigerated and covered.  In this way, the amount of bacteria that is \nalready present or enters the food is controlled.  Proper refrigeration ---below 40\u00b0F \nretards the rapid multiplication of bacteria.  Maintaining  a temperature of 140\u00b0 F or \nover discourages bacteria in hot foods.  \n \nTeam Members must be checked out by the medical department or a doctor if they have \nthe following symptoms:  \n \n1. Gastrointestinal disorders.  \n2. Sore throat or persistent cough.  \n3. Skin lesions, boi ls on hands or other parts of body.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  55 \n \nTeam Members must be made aware of the importance of washing their hands often with \nsoap and hot water.  Specifically, hands must be washed:  \n \n1. After using restrooms.  \n2. After smoking.  \n3. Anytime you touch your hair or skin.  \n4. Before any food prep activity.  \n5. After handling money.  \n6. After busing tables.  \n7. After mopping or sweeping.  \n8. After putting stock away.  \n9. Upon return from a break.  \n10. Before you clock into work.  \n11. After emptying trash.  \n12. After daily cleanup.  \n13. Before handling any food or clean utensils.  \n \nIn other words, anytime you may have picked up bacteria from a non -sanitary surface.  \nWashing hands often with soap and water and drying them with a sanitary towel will \nreduce the transfer of harmful bacteria from your hands to other food contact surfaces.  \nSummation  \n \nHeat hot foods to over 140\u00b0 F as fast as possible and keep them at that temperature or \nchill them as quickly as possible.  Cold foods must be chilled to below 40\u00b0 F as quickly \nas possible.  Do not prolong preparation of foods.  Deviating from the desirable \ntemperatures for too long invites bacteria that we try to control.  \n \nHere are three rules to follow concerning food safety and sanitation:  \n \n1. Keep it hot or keep it cold.  \n2. Keep it covered.  \n3. When in doubt\u2026throw it out!  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  56 \n \nGeneral Electrical Safety  \n \n1. Use quality electrical equipment; look for the underwriters label (signifying approved \nby the underwriters laboratory) on the equipment.  \n2. Only qualified electricians must be permitted to perform electrical work.  \n3. Stay off wet or da mp footing areas when using electrical appliances.  Do not use \nelectrical equipment while standing in the rain.  Keep your hands dry.  \n4. Use the appropriate sizes of electrical cords (light or heavy -duty).  \n5. Never pull the plug out of an outlet by yanking the c ord. \n6. Motors must be used in accordance with their designated horsepower - do not \noverload.  \n7. Any small shocks from equipment are a warning of leaking electricity and must be \nrepaired immediately.  \n8. All portable electric tools must be grounded and their power always turned off when \nnot in use.  \n9. Set up a preventative maintenance inspection system for electrical equipment to \nprevent electrical hazards before someone is injured.  \n10. All electrical installations and utilization of equipment shall be installed and \nmainta ined in accordance with the provision of the national electrical code nfpa 70 -\n1968 (ansi -c-i-1968).  \n \nFire Hazards  \n \nIn the event of a fire occurring at a restaurant, it is up to the management to take charge \nof the situation.  Fires vary greatly is size and  nature, sound judgment must be applied.  \nIn general, there are two major objectives to be accomplished:  \n \n1. Eliminate the danger to customers and employees.  \n2. Minimize damage to the store premises.  \n \nFire Prevention  \n \n1. Keep combustible material and supplies a saf e distance from hot water heaters and \nother cooking equipment.  \n2. Practice good housekeeping at all times.  \n3. Clean filters and hoods on cooking equipment on a regular basis.  \n4. Check gas jets and pilot lights frequently.  Promptly report any odor of gas.  \n5. Do not ov erload outlets or use temporary wiring.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  57 \n \nFire Emergency Plan  \n \nThe key to the success of any emergency plan during an actual emergency is that store \npersonnel are given specific responsibilities and instructed on how to perform these \nduties before the eme rgency occurs.  \n \n1. Train all Team Members in the use of the fire extinguishers.  \n2. Show all Team Members where the gas cut -offs are and how to turn off the gas \nmains.  Keep a wrench or pliers near that location.  \n3. Show all Team Members where the circuit breakers are.  Ensure that the markings are \nclear.  \n4. Pre-arrange responsibilities in the event of a fire.  \n \nAccidents and New Employees  \n \nSurveys show that 60 percent of all accidents involve Team Members who have been \nwith a company less than one year.  In the restaurant business, at any given time, there \nare a number of Team Members working in our restaurants that are relatively new.  They  \nwork during peak periods, full -time and part -time.  Therefore, extra effort must be made \nto make the Team Members \u201csafe for the job and the job safe for the Team Members\u201d.  \n \nThe first step is to carefully interview the applicant, and determine that the per son is \nsuited to do the job.  \n \nOnce management has ascertained that the applicant is qualified, the next step is to make \ncertain that the new Team Members receives all the proper safety instructions.  \n \nStress that each Team Member is responsible for his/her owns safety and obeying safety \nrules is a condition of employment!  \n \nNew Team Member safety indoctrination must not stop here.  \n \nBeginning with the Team Members first day at work, the manager must spend time \npointing out safety procedures and potentially uns afe conditions that may be encountered \non the job.  Stress the importance of having a \u201csafe job\u201d attitude.  \n \nThe number of part -time personnel employed by Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s places  additional \nimportance on the need for thorough safety training.  Many part -time Team Members are \nstudents who have already completed a full day in class when they arrive at work.  They \nmust adjust to a completely different environment.  It is imperative that our safety \nprocedures and regulations be reviewed periodically with Tea m Members.  Only in this \nway can we prevent injury and retain our excellent safety record.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  58 \n \nAccident Investigating and Reporting  \n \nAccident investigation is a fact -finding process.  The objective of an accident report is to:  \n \n1. Obtain complete and true information about the alleged accident or incident.  \n2. Identify hazardous conditions and unsafe acts or practices.  \n3. Give the accident investigator as much as possible to help process the claim.  \n \nKeep the Atmosphere of the Investigation Informal.  \n \n1. Do not put the verbal comments of witnesses in writing while they are giving their \naccounts of the accident.  \n2. Wait until you are away from witnesses to write your report.  You can always check \nyour written report with them to verify that the facts they reported ar e accurate.  \n \nUse Common Sense:  Stick to the Facts.  \n \n1. Make no assumptions and take nothing for granted.  \n2. Do not look upon the accident investigation as additional work, but rather as an \nopportunity to correct an unsafe situation.  \n \nInvestigate Each Sequence.  \n \nAn apparently reasonable conclusion will often be changed by exploring facts that were \nnot considered important enough to be mentioned.  \n \nCheck for Unsafe Conditions and Actions.  \n \nState what unsafe conditions contributed to the accident. They are always pr esent when \naccidents occur.  Give reasons for their existence, if possible.  List any unsafe acts \ninvolved.  Why did they occur?  Note: never accept an investigation report that says an \nemployee was \u201ccareless\u201d.  This is a result, never a cause.  If you thi nk the employee was \ncareless, find out why.  There is always a cause.  \n \nMake the necessary recommendations for corrective action to your supervisor and send a \ncopy to the corporate insurance department.  \n \nFollow up to see that the corrective recommendations have been put into effect.  \n \nThe following questions and answers will help you in accident investigations.  \n \n1. Which accidents must be investigated? All of them.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  59 \n \n2. When must the accident investigation be made? Immediately after the accident.  \nDelays can permit p ertinent evidence to be removed or change and important \ninformation forgotten.  \n3. What questions are necessary to accident investigation?  There are six basic questions \nthat must be answered:  \na. Who was injured?  \nb. When did it happen?  \nc. Why did it occur?  \nd. What were th e unsafe conditions or unsafe practices involved?  \ne. Where did it happen?  \nf. How did it happen?  \n4. Must separate accident reports be used for Team Member and Guest accidents? Yes.  \nCertain types of information for one do not have to be recorded for the other.  (See  \nsections of employee injury and public injury).  \n5. Who must investigate accidents?

Your goal in the investigation is not to establish fault, but \nto establish and correct the cause.  Employees will omit vital points in their exchanges \nwith management if they fear repercussions from their statements, either from their \nmanager  or fellow Team Members.  \n \nInformation required in completing the first report of injury:  \n \n1.

If unknown or not always the same use \naverage number of days worked per week or number of days Team Member was \nscheduled during week of a ccident.  Unless noted otherwise, it will be assumed that an 8 -\nhour shift was scheduled.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  61 \n \nLength of Service with Company  \n \nThe total time the Team Member has been employed without a break in service.  \n \nRate of Pay  \n \nThe rate of pay for the Team Member is on  an hourly basis and daily basis.  \n \nAddress Where Accident Occurred and Store Number  \n \nGive address of accident and store number whether it is Team Member is permanently \nassigned store or a temporary duty store.  \n \nCan Team Member Perform Regular Job?  \n \n1.

Make certain no liability statements are made by store personnel.  It is extremely \nimportant that neither store management nor Team Members make a statement \nregarding the cause of accident or payment for damages.  The only statement that \nmust be  made is that a report will be submitted to the corporate office for evaluation \nand the person will be contacted.  \n2. Correct any conditions which might have caused the incident to prevent a recurrence.  \n3.

For the company to recover money for losses, obtain and record as much information \nas possible, such as:  \n \n\uf0b7 Name, address, phone number and driver\u2019s license number of persons involved, \nincluding witnesses.  \n\uf0b7 Description and license number of any vehic le involved in an accident.  \n\uf0b7 List and description of damaged items.  \n\uf0b7 Date, time and conditions of the accident.  \n\uf0b7 Any other pertinent data.  \n \nMake certain all Team Members are trained to make no liability statements and \nto gather all pertinent data.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  65 \n \nSecurity  \n \nRegister Security  \n \nSince you work with money, you must also be concerned with robbery, internal theft or \nshort -change artists.  This is a serious subject, and you must follow these procedures very \ncarefully to maintain proper safekeeping of the restauran t\u2019s employees and assets.  \n \nWhen leaving the register for any reason, keep both security and customers in mind.  This \nmeans you must:  \n\uf0b7 Lock the register . \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the register and on the line for upcoming guest.  \n\uf0b7 Never keep guest waiting at the register .  \n \nIn addition, you must keep the register locked when you\u2019re not at the cashier station to \nkeep delivery or service personnel (or even fellow employees) from opening the register \nand taking money from the register.  Often it\u2019s hard to believe one of your  fellow workers \nwould steal money, but it does occasionally happen.  Remember, you will be held \naccountable for shortages in your cash drawer.  \n \nShort -change Artists  \n \nDO NOT interrupt a transaction to discuss anything. Quick change artists and \ncounterfeiters may try to get you confused.  Sometimes they work in pairs.  \n1. If interrupted, say: \u201cJust a moment, please.  I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d  \n2. Finish transaction.  \n3. Then say: \u201c Thank you for waiting.  How may I help you?\u201d  \n4. If, when you are counting back money they interrupt to ask for additional change or \nfor additional purchase, tell them you will take care of them as soon as you finish \ncounting back their money.  Criminals often  try to confuse the CASHIER with an \ninterruption.  DON\u2019T let it happen to you.  \n\uf0b7 DO NOT take money from two people at the same time.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the bill on the register shelf until you finish transaction.  \n\uf0b7 DO keep the drawer closed when ringing up the order.  \n \nIf they give you currency that has handwriting or any other obvious marks on it, make a \ncasual comment about it.  Some quick -change artists work in pairs in order to have the \nfirst one use a larger denomination marked bill, and when the second one comes th rough \nthe line, he will use a smaller bill.  But once the change has been given, and the drawer is \nclosed, he will politely say there may have been a mistake and he gave you a larger bill.  \nTo convince you, he will even refer to a specific handwritten note  or mark on the larger \nbill.  You look in your drawer and find the very bill he is referring to, and if you hadn\u2019t  \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  66 \n \nnoticed it before, you may feel compelled to return the extra change.  After all, he sounds \nso convincing and so harmless.  \n \nCounterfeit Mone y \n \nCounterfeiters usually deal only with large bills (i.e. Twenties, fifties, hundreds) although \noccasionally they will use $5 or $10 bills.  \n \nConsult with your manager on how to recognize counterfeit bills.  If you suspect you \nhave been given a counterfei t bill, you must do the following:  \n\uf0b7 Do not  return it to the Guest until the manager has instructed you to do so.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  physically grab the Guest. This could lead to a lawsuit if the money is \nNOT counterfeit!  \n\uf0b7 Do not  accuse the Guest.  You are not a government agent, so don\u2019t try to act like \none.  \n\uf0b7 Call the manager immediately . \n \nRobbery  \n \nIf a robbery occur s at the register during business hours, it is important to remember one \nword \u201c Cooperate\u201d.   Do not try to be a hero or resist a robbery attempt.  Your life is more \nvaluable than the money in the drawer.  \n \nIf a robbery must occur, do the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Do whatever the robber asks within reason.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and avoid sudden movements.  \n\uf0b7 Give the robber all the money in the register.  \n\uf0b7 Be alert and notice features (height, weight, attire, color of eyes, scars, etc\u2026) \ndon\u2019t  be obvious about this ! \n\uf0b7 Contact the manager immediately after they leave and have someone call the \npolice.  \n \nSome things you can do to red uce the risks of robbery:  \n \n\uf0b7 Be aware of suspicious -acting guests.  \n\uf0b7 Be suspicious of guests who ask questions about how much business you do each \nday, who stare at the money in the drawer, or who linger near the cashier area for \nno apparent reason, or people who stay in the restaurant for a long period of time \nwithout eati ng or drinking anything.  \n\uf0b7 Make frequent money drops during your shift, removing all large bills from your \nregister. Check with your manager on how and when to do this.  \n\uf0b7 Keep the cash register door closed at all times except when conducting sales \ntransactio ns.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  67 \n \n\uf0b7 Keep the register key in a hidden location.  \n \nSecurity in our units is paramount. There are factions in our society that will try and \ninitiate criminal activities against restaurants. Please read carefully and do not put your \nunit, management staff or team members in harm\u2019s way.  \n \nOpening Procedures  \n\uf0b7 In the morning, circle the building in your vehicle checking to see if all the doors \nare secured before entering. When in doubt be cautious, don\u2019t go in. Call the \npolice to clear the building before entering.   \n \nDeposits and Cash Handling  \n \nWhen making a deposit, try to vary the time you go to the bank. Do not let it be routine. \nMake deposits during the daylight hours.  When going to the bank be aware of any \nsuspicious looking vehicles. If you identify any, ride  by and come back at a different \ntime.  \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on bushes, trees or any other obstacles that could be used as a place \nto hide while waiting for a depositor.  \n\uf0b7 Make cash drops regularly so that you never have over $400 in the cash drawer.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving to make a deposit do not run any other errands before making the \ndeposit. Go straight to the bank. Money left in the car is an easy target.  \n\uf0b7 When going to the bank to make a deposit make sure that when coming to a stop \nlight you leave plenty of space in between cars so that you cannot be boxed in \neasily and are able to maneuver your car out of the space.  \n\uf0b7 If there are pedestrians in the vicinity make sure you are aware of their \nmovements and how close they are to your vehicle. Chose the farthest distance \nfrom them.  \n\uf0b7 When leaving with money do not make it apparent that you are carrying a deposit.  \n\uf0b7 If possible when transporting money to or from the unit try to have someone meet \nyou at your car outside the front door while you are in your vehicle. Walking from  \nthe far end of the parking lot with large amounts of money makes you an easy \ntarget.  \n\uf0b7 Always count money in a secure place out of the view of Guest s and Team \nMembers. The office must be used to count money and always have the door \nclosed and locked. Team Members do not need to know the cash handling aspects \nof our business or how much cash may be on the property at a time.  \n\uf0b7 Have 2 drawers available so that the drawers can be switched out seamlessly \nduring the mid shift and the other drawer counted in the of fice. While counting \ndown the AM drawer make sure to have someone monitoring the shift. It must \ntake no longer than 10 minutes to count down the mid shift drawer.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  68 \n \nDeliveries  \n \n\uf0b7 When accepting deliveries, make sure to be aware of the surroundings before \nopening the door. Shut the door securely and then check in the product. Walk the \ndelivery agents to the door and let them out after the surroundings have been \nobserved and then secure the door.  \n\uf0b7 The back door must never be left unattended. A manager must alway s be present.  \n \nStructure Security  \n \n\uf0b7 Locate the main breaker boxes that are outside the building during the day time \nand ensure they are secure. If the lights go out in the building do not run outside. \nThis may be a rouse to get the door open. If lights do go out remain inside, call \nthe polic e to come and check out the building and surrounding before opening the \ndoor.  \n\uf0b7 Install a peep hole on the back door and/or mirrors to allow you to see around \ncorners.  \n\uf0b7 Put an alarm bar on the back door. The alarm bar must always be in place. The \ndoor must remain closed after dark.  \n\uf0b7 If you have cameras make sure they are functioning.  \n\uf0b7 A well -lit place will not be as easy a target. If lights are out around your building mak e \nsure to quickly get them replaced. Criminals will stage their crime scenes well.  \n \n \nPublic Relations  \n \n\uf0b7 Cater to law enforcement guests when they come in. Thank them regularly for the \nhard work they perform and for patrolling your area. The more times you have the \nPolice seen in and around your building the more secure you will be.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  69 \n \nClosing Procedures  \n \n\uf0b7 Leave for the night  in pairs. The last 2 people must follow this procedure. First \nlook both ways out the door and let the first person go.  After they are  secure in \ntheir car and have observed the surroundings, flash your headlights to the person \ninside. The first person out must wait until the second person is safely in their car \nand car is started before leaving. The person inside must be close to a phone  ready \nto call 911 if the first person out is accosted.  Do not hesitate time is crucial.  \n\uf0b7 Do not  allow anybody in th e building after closing except  for those closing the \nshift. This includes off the clock Team Members or family members of someone \nworking. People waiting to give an employee a ride must wait outside.  \n\uf0b7 Do not let the Team Members exit or enter from the back door.  \n\uf0b7 After closing hours, lock the door even if there is still guest in the restaurant. Let \nthem out when they want to go. Be observant of all areas outside before opening \nthe door, someone could be hiding nearby.  \n\uf0b7 Be aware of any suspicious people that come in just before closing.  \n\uf0b7 Make your last trash run before dark and attend the door during the run. During \ndaylight savings time make tra sh runs early in the evening. Leave the last trash \ncontainer inside and dispose of it in the morning. The manager must be present at \nthe door during the trash run to ensure someone is not hiding behind the dumpster \nand then walking your team member in the back door.  \n\uf0b7 Before closing and after the late night guest are out of the front parking spaces \nmove your vehicles closer to the unit. Try and park away from any other cars so \nyou will have a clear view around your vehicle upon leaving. Do not park around \nobstructions in the area such as trees, bushes, landscaping accoutrements etc.  \n\uf0b7 When going to your vehicle make sure your key is in your hand and ready to open \nthe door.  \n\uf0b7 Do not carry numerous items out with you late which will prevent you from \nquickly enter ing your vehicle.  \n\uf0b7 If you have to scrape ice off your windows be observant of your surrounding \nduring the process.  \n \n   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page  70 \n \nCrisis Management  \n \nIn the case of a Natural Disasters which would include the following circumstances  \n \n\uf0b7 Tornado  \n\uf0b7 Hurricane  \n\uf0b7 Flood  \n\uf0b7 Major Power Outage  \n \nThe following steps must take place.  \n\uf0b7 Secure the unit by moving all Guests and Team Members away from windows, \ndoors and patio.  \n\uf0b7 Remain calm and move those in the building to a safe place i.e. Prep area, Walk -\nin Cooler, Restrooms.  \n\uf0b7 Keep all p eople calm and monitor the situation. If possible monitor TV to see the \nstatus and when all is clear for business to resume.  \n \nYour Guests and Team Members will be looking for you to control the situation. During \na team meeting discuss the proper steps that  would be taken if such occurrence takes \nplace.  \n \nIf there is a power outage call the power company to get updates on when power will be \nrestored, it may only be a matter of minutes. As soon the power company is called inform \nyour supervisor and seek knowle dge. \n \nIn the case of Media on Premises regarding a situation the following steps must be taken.  \n \n\uf0b7 Be polite and let them know you need a few minutes.

Do not look at the bottom of \nthis page!  \n \nThe cost of training one hourly Team Member is?  \n \n1. $850  \n2. $980  \n3. $1099  \n4. $1508  \n5. $2077  \n6. $2200 \n7. $2400  \n \nThe cost of losing a family of 4 who had a bad experience and tells 10 of their friends \nwill be lost Top Line  sales of?  \n \n1. $750  \n2. $980  \n3. $1190  \n4. $1800  \n5. $2400  \n6. $5000  \n7. $9000  \n \nThis scenario is based upon a family of 4 with a check average of $25 visiting 3 times per \nmonth. That total would be $75 a month. Assume that this family\u2019s bad experience is \nshared with 10 other families of 4 who will never dine with us because of this 1 bad \nexperience and 1 poor recommendation! Here is how the numbers work:  \n \n$75 per month with each family of 4 dinning 3 times per month times the 10 families!  \nThat number is $750 in lost sales for 1 month. Take that $750 and annualize that!  \nYou have lost $9000 in sales due to 1 bad experience that a Family of 4 had.  \n \nThis scenario could  be very real. It is a fact that for every bad experience a Guest has in \nthe service industry, they tell 10 people! Think about your past negative experiences you \nhad while dinning. Did you go back? Did you tell anyone about your experience?  \n \nThe answer t o question 1 is number 7=$2400! According to People Report  in 2004 the \ncost for training 1 Team Member was $2400. This cost includes: training wages, wages \nto the trainers, cost of management time spent with new hire, cost of uniform, cost of \nmanuals, cost  in food waste, and payroll taxes.   \n \nCheeseb urger Bobby\u2019s Manager in Training Manual \u00a9 -

What do you have to do to make \nyour operation a shining example of efficiency and or ganization? We will touch on many \nof the key components needed and give you a checklist of sorts of what responsibilities \nyou need to focus on in order to be a successful General Manager, an asset to \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s, and your Franchisee.  \n \nIt takes hard work, dedication, consistency, perseverance and passion to be a phenomenal \nGeneral Manager. Those who emulate the above will reap the rewards and continue their \njourney to the next level and be successful in obtaining your financial goals.  \n \nTaking pri de in your work and operating with little supervision without constant \naccolades is sometimes the road you must travel. You must be self propelled in finding \nyour way without losing steam in our environment.   \n \nWe will be supplying you with a list of items , task, and challenges that you must be \naware of to be successful. You are not expected to complete all of them, however the \nteam that you build is. As you assign tasks to your fellow managers remember you need \nto develop your team and set the expectations  as well as give them the tools to complete \nthe assignment that you give to them.  \n \nThey will only be successful at the assignment if you set them up for success. You are \ntheir best resource for knowledge and guidance.  \n \nREMEMBER IF THEY LOSE, YOU LOSE!!!  \n \nWhat are the Key Characteristics  of the successful manager?  \n \n\uf0d8 Passionate  \uf0d8 Understanding  \uf0d8 Guest Focused   \n\uf0d8 Self Motivated  \n \n\uf0d8 Sympathetic  \uf0d8 Fast Paced  \uf0d8 Multi -task \noriented   \n\uf0d8 Detail Oriented  \n \n \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 96 \n \nAlong with these Key Characteristic points Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s has created a list of \ncritical points to exceptional management. These Manager Criticals have 11 key points. If \nyou hold yourself and your management team to these standards we will all be winners. \n(It is also suggested that the Manager Criticals be used as a standard when writing \nperformance reviews of your management team).  \n \nAt Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s we believe that setting attainable goals is an intricate part of \nour success. When writing your BURGER goals or your managers are writing their goals \nuse the Key Characteristics and the Manager Criticals as a bench mark in your \npreparation.  \n \nRunning 14 great shifts per week (14/14) is the number one priority for each member of \nthe management team. If we are not running a great 14/14 we run the risk of delivering \npoor service or food to a first time Guest. You as a manager  must ensure the proper \nscheduling coverage is provided in each of those shifts. Your heavy volume shifts will be \nFriday am/pm, Saturday am/pm, and Sunday am/pm. These account for over 60% of your \nbusiness. As the General Manager you want to be on duty these shifts to ensure the Team \nis executing to 100% of the standard.  \n \nThese days are real Game Days, in football terms. Every shift is live and the game has \nbegun! When writing the manager schedule t he General Manager (The Head Coach) must \nbe working each Game Day. It is suggested that Monday morning is the best time for the \nGeneral Manager to be doing administrative office work including:  \n \n\uf0b7 Inventory  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing your key cost areas: Food Cost/Paper/Labo r \n\uf0b7 Doing the weekly Profit loss Statement  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing last week\u2019s  sales  \n\uf0b7 Forecasting the coming week\u2019s sales/labor  \n\uf0b7 Marketing strategy meetings  \n\uf0b7 Holding Manager meetings/suggested 2 per month  \n\uf0b7 Manager or Key Team Member  1on1\u2019s/suggested 4 per month  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing Ord er Books  \n \nThink of this in terms of the head football coach. He is watching films from last week and \nplanning for his upcoming game.  \n \nThe GM/Franchisee must make time to review and get the team focused for the upcoming \nweek.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 97 \n \nQualifying Your Team  \n \nDeveloping your team is one of the best ways to insure your success. Providing the time \nand resources to make someone great promotes you as a great leader and team builder.  \nThis ensures that everybody is knowledgeable and efficient at their jobs. When tea m \nmembers know the expectations and have a knowledge base to draw from they get much \nmore proficient at a task.  Having numerous individuals effective at different positions \ngives you the flexibility to have a maximum impact  on the operation and your shif t. \n \nEach week you must be meeting with your fellow managers to discuss the team\u2019s training \nneeds. Identify who needs development and plan for it. If you don\u2019t have the time to \ndevelop your team you will fight endless battles during each shift. Investing in  training \ntime with your team members will pay off in the form of smoother shifts and increase the \ntime you have to build sales later on.  \n \nYour team members must be tested on each position of the restaurant. You can verbally \nqualify the team by asking ques tions about each task they are performing.  \n \nHuman Resources  \n \nCounseling Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Identify the problem, giving specifics in a calm and friendly fashion.  \n3. Ask the employee for his/her input on the problem, paraphrasing the informatio n \nhe/she provides.  \n4. Ask the employee for a plan.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out the commitments.  \n6. Agree on a time and place to follow -up. \n \nDisciplining Team Members  \n \n1. Greet the employee.  \n2. Review the problem discussed in the previous meeting, what was agreed to, and w hat \nhas happened since.  \n3. Ask the team member for his /her input, paraphrasing the information he/she \nprovides.  \n4. Ask the team member what he/she plans to do.  \n5. Summarize, spelling out commitments.  \n6. Notify the team member of necessary formal procedures.  \n7. Agree on a time and place for follow up.   \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 98 \n \nLeadership  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s managers  represent the ideal team member, and they provide the \nexample from which other team members model their behavior.  Managers must lead by \nexample by showing an excellent work ethic , following Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  \nand procedures, and displaying outstanding Guest service.  \n \nAs managers, you have to realize how important our role is. The  Guest experience is \ndirectly impacted by how we organize our crew and utilize our time and the team\u2019s time.  \n \nEnforcing Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Standards   \n \nIn addition to exemplifying the model Team Member, managers will also take an active \nrole in enforcing  Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s standards  as they apply to food quality, \ncleanliness, employee hygiene, uniforms, and service. The following must be consistently \nenforced each and every shift.  \n \n1. Quality of food  \u2013 Only the freshest, hottest product must be served to the Guest. \nInsure that quality line checks are getting done before each shift. Take this time to \nguarantee all products meet our standards. They need to meet the FAT test. \nF=Flavor A=Appearance T=Temperature . If we are 100% in compliance with the \nFAT profi le we will exceed what the Guest expects.   \n2. Hygiene \u2013Team Members must be neatly groomed each and every time they come to \nwork.  Baths, deodorants, mouthwashes, and colognes are all known to be protective \nmeasures.  Hair must be cleaned and neatly combed; long hair must be restrained. \nArrive to work in 100% proper uniform.  \n3. Uniforms \u2013Team Members must be instructed as to the designated uniform to be \nworn in the restaurant.  The Cheeseburger  Bobby\u2019s  uniform  includes: black, non -slip \nsoled shoes (no sneakers), black belt, and pressed black pants, pressed Cheeseburger \nBobby\u2019s shirt , name tag  and Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s hat.  This uniform must be worn \nat all times and with all of the accessories issued. The most i mportant part of your \nuniform is a sincere SMILE ! A smile is such a critical part of our uniform. A great \nSmile radiates a contagious feeling to your fellow Team Members and our Guest.  \n4. Service \u2013 The distinguishing feature of Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s is our ou tstanding \nGuest service.  As a result, managers must make Guest service their number one \npriority.  You only get one chance to make a first impression with our Guest. We \nmust WOW our Guests with awesome service and great food.  \n5. Sanitation - Our Guests like to know they are eating in a clean, sanitized and well run \nbusiness. Every Team Member must be very conscious of sanitation, using gloves \nwhen required and washing their hands often. Keeping your Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nclean is everyone on t he TEAMS job.  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s basic operating principles are the heart to our success. Each of \nthese principles is basic and simple to execute. Each must become standard behaviour in  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 99 \n \nthe execution of running shifts. It must be clear to all managers that being active with \nGuests and Team Members during hours of Operation is a standard requirement. Between \nthe hours of 11a.m. -2 p.m. and between the hours of 5p.m. -9p.m. a manager or Key team \nmember must be out front on the floor. If you must leave for a ny reason communicate to \nthe shift leader.  \n \nThe Home Base Principle : This is a simple principle that leads to great execution.  \n \nWhen running a shift one of the key locations for the manager  to always be keyed into is \nthe make table. From there 100% of the  food quality and most of the service and \ncleanliness standards can be managed identified and rectified by the manager or by \ngiving direction to a team member. When working your 8 steps always return to HOME \nBASE.  \n \nGetting out from behind the line must tak e place about every 20 minutes.  \nAdditionally, as the manager walks the dining room he/she must also be quickly checking \nthe restrooms for cleanliness and stocking issues. Walk the back of the house to follow up \non the prep, dish and storage procedures.  \n \nLittle time must be spent in the office. Our business is so simplistic that during open \nhours the manager must not be in the office at all. It is imperative to the success of the \nbusiness to focus on what is inside the 4 walls in the front of the house. Wh en leaving \nHome Base always manage these 2 important action plans:  \n \n1. Praise the appropriate behaviors; this promotes more of the same.  \n \n2. Coach to the standard, if you do not address substandard work quality you in essence \nmake a new standard. When you don\u2019t address inappropriate work behavior the Team \nMember thinks that you don\u2019t really know the standard yourself and lose respect for \nyou as well.  \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 100 \n \nRunning a Quality Shift: Managing the 8\u2019s  \n \nBelow are the Managers Figure 8\u2019s items.

This lets your guests know t hat they are important to you.  \n \nIf small children are in the group, ask the parents if a high chair or booster seat is needed.  \nDo not place the child in the chair yourself.  \n \nIf the rush is hectic, acknowledge your guests by smiling and cheerfully asking h ow they \nare doing.  This lets them know that you are aware of their presence and establishes your \napproachability.  \n \nGreet your guests with a smile.  If you know your guest\u2019s name, then be sure to use it.  \nGreet guests with different greetings so that you d o not sound like a parrot that has \nmemorized his lines.  Always speak clearly and  patiently. Repeat yourself if necessary \nfor your guests.  Be polite and say \u201cple ase\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d and  \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure!\u201d \nrespectfully to them.

This is your last opportunity to impress the customer.  \nLet your guest know that you are excited they chose Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s.  \n \nFour Ways to Impress Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Guest.  \n \n1. Execute Guest orders quickly and flawlessly.  \n2. Learn guest names.  \n3. Learn how to spot first time Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Guests.  You may ask Guests if \nthis is his/her first visit.

Never say you don\u2019t like a particular product.  Say, \u201cMany of our Guest\u2019s love that \nbut my favorite is\u2026\u201d  \n3. Thank Guests for all compliments whether they are directed at you, the restaurant, or \nsomeone else.  \n4. Don\u2019t let one unhappy or unappreciative Guest affect the service to another.  If a \nGuest has a pro blem, correct it as tactfully and graciously as possible and move on to \nthe next Guest.  \n5. Speak well of your restaurant\u2019s food, service, management, and team members both \ninside and outside the restaurant.  \n6. Never say no to a Guest request, even though it may sound outrageous, e ither do it or \noffer an alternative . \n \nHelpful Management Tips  \n \n\uf0b7 Keep an eye on the parking lot. When you see numerous cars pull in you can \nassume that you will need burger patties. Get them on the grill. It will take them \nabout 1 -2 minutes to get in the door, 1 -2 minutes to place their order, get cups, \nand pay. By the time they get to their table their order must almost be completed.  \n\uf0b7 You must have the appropriate par levels of baskets to get through a busy shift \nwithout having to was h any. This situation gives you the ability to focus on \nturning tables and taking care of the guest rather than constantly monitoring \nequipment amounts during peak volume.  \n\uf0b7 Cross -utilize your staff effectively. If you need more tables cleaned pull team \nmem bers from other areas to assist getting tables cleaned. Remember the more  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 104 \n \npositions your team members can perform the more efficient and flexible your \nrestaurant can be run. Imagine a work force where everyone can perform in every \nposition. You then have f lexibility, numerous trainers and the power to discipline \nyour team when needed without the fear of that member walking out leaving you \nhigh and dry.  \n\uf0b7 Make sure your OMC checklists are completed. The best way to prepare for a \nshift is to be set up.  \n\uf0b7 Be cert ain you have plenty of change in the till. Taking time in the middle of a \nbusy shift is not good. You have numerous other responsibilities you have to be \nlooking after.  \n \nThe HOW\u2019s  \n \nRemember your restaurants success depends on the HOW\u2019S  \nHOW fresh are your  products?  \nHOW clean is your restaurant?  \nHOW great is the service?  \n \nAt $3000 worth of sales that equals about 400 guests dining at Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s a \nday. That is 400+ people talking about HOW great or HOW bad a dining experience they \nhad.  \n \nThat\u2019s a lot of word of mouth floating around a community.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 105 \n \nLabor Scheduling  \n \nThe Work Schedule is a most valuable tool available to you.  If it is used properly, your \nrestaurant will run well, stay clean and maintain controls.  The schedule is your overall \nplan for each day, week and month.  Labor hours are both an expense and a resource.  By \nhaving the right people working at the right time you maximize sales and deliver the best \ncustomer experience while staying on budget.  \n \nThere are several tools that you need to build a Work Schedule:  \n \n\uf0b7 Availability Worksheet:  this is your list of employees with the days and hours \nthey are available and the lists the positions they can work.  \n\uf0b7 Hourly Sales Guide:  projecting sales is the foundation of making a sched ule.  The \nHourly Sales Guide provides the historical sales to help you project the current \nweek\u2019s sales.  \n\uf0b7 Promotion Schedule/Calendar:  planning for coupons drops, product promotions, \nand school nights allows you to have the staff on hand for potential sale s increases \nper day and per shift.  \n\uf0b7 Labor Productivity Chart:  this chart gives you the information to determine the \nnumber of staff needed per sales hour taking into account the experience of your \nstaff.  \n \nBefore you start to make out a schedule, be sure yo u have the tools you need have been \nupdated with current information:  \n \n \u2022     The most recent Hourly Sales Guide  \n \u2022     Employee Availability Form  \n \u2022     Employee requests for days off  \n\u2022 Promotion schedule  \n\u2022 Last week's Work Schedule  \n \nBe sure you choose a quiet place to do the schedule where you will not be interrupted.  \nGive yourself at least 1 to 2 hours to complete it.  Before starting review the following:  \n \n1.  Sales Projections are the most important part of scheduling since they provide \nthe basis for all other computations.  \na. Use Hourly Sales Guide to compute the average of last 2 -3 similar \nweeks  \nb. Adjust for promotions or LSM efforts.  \nc. Revise for local events such as parades, concerts, or ball games.  Look \nat the Hourly Sales  Guide for previous year sales on the event dates.   \nd. Review previous week's schedule for observations that apply to current \nweek.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 106 \n \n2.  Do Sales projections by hour for each day of the week.  \n \n3.  Determine number of people needed per hour.  \n \nOnce you have  determined the hour's sales, determine the number of \npeople needed using the Labor Productivity Chart.  Consider which part of \nthe hour has the most sales to determine if people should be brought in on \nthe 1/2 hour.  Consider your team's experience level and position \nknowledge when scheduling.  \n \n4.  Schedule Management shifts.  \n \nMake sure a Management person (including Shift Manager) is responsible \nfor each shift. Keep the Management overlap to as little as possible.  The \nmanager should always be in the rest aurant during the busiest times and \nshould work some weekends and nights.  Schedule time for management \nresponsibilities.  \n \n5.  Add hours for all additional jobs.   \n a. Opening  \n b. Set -up prep       \nc. Closing     \n d. Orientation/Training  \n \n6.  Add hours for special events and LSM activities.  \n  \n7.  Double check that you are within the labor standard for the week.  \n \nCalculate the hours you project to use based on the projected sales \nvolume.  Look carefully over your projections and your numbers of people \nto catc h any weak spots or errors.  \n \nThe minimum coverage for lunch is four people between 11:30 am and 2 \npm and three people at minimum during all other hours of operation.  It is \nhighly recommended to have four people on staff from 5 pm to 8:30 pm.  \n \n8.  Invest a dditional hours to build the business.  \n a. Lunch  \n b. Dinner  \n \nIf you have scheduled to beat the standard for the week, look for places to invest \nadditional hours to build the business.   \n \n9.  Write in names.   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 107 \n \n  \nWhen figuring your team's placement on the sche dule, consider \npersonalities that work together well.  Also schedule your inexperienced \nstaff with the more experienced.   Once the names and positions are filled \nin, schedule a break for each person working over a 5 hour shift; make \nsure the area is cover ed.  Always make time for training and cross \ntraining. If you have staff that worked a fixed weekly schedule, put them \non the schedule first.  \n \n10.  Schedule breaks.  \n \nAlways schedule breaks along non -peak hours.  Block that person off the \nschedule and make  sure they're covered.  \n \n11.  Review training needs/goals and revise shifts as needed to have experts \nworking when training will take place.  \n \nSchedule trainees with strong employees that can pick up the slack for a \nnew person.  The restaurant manager should  always work with new people \non their first day.  \n \n12.  Post by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.  \n \nThe schedule is a management tool.  If sales are consistently down, you will need to \nadjust the rest of the week's sales in addition to the labor and product needs.  Nev er wait \nuntil Sunday to adjust for the week's low sales.  Let the schedule help you by marking \nspecial situations.  Also, mark on the schedule communications or motivations; you'll be \nsurprised how many of your staff will read it.  \n \nAvailability Worksheet  \nThe Availability Worksheet is used as a reference for scheduling and hiring needs.  It is a \nrecord for when employees are available to work throughout the week as well as in what \npositions they are proficient.  \n \nHow to use:  \n  \n 1.  List employee name and pho ne number under the appropriate day/part.  \n 2.  Mark the days of the week the employee can work.  \n 3.  Rank the positions in which the employee can work.  \n 4.  Keep this chart with you when completing the schedule.  \n 5.  Write in employee's age if under 18.  \n  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 108 \n \nThe Availability Worksheet can be an invaluable tool for scheduling and covering \npositions during sickness or employee shortages.  \n \n \nManager Schedule  \n \nPrepare a monthly manager schedule and post it the week before the preceding month.  \nThe manager schedule must take into account management responsibilities and upcoming \nevents including:  Local Store Marketing, holidays, days off and meetings.  Completing a \nmonthly schedule for managers allows them to better balance their work and personal \nlives.  It insures that critical manager tasks are planned for and completed on time.  The \nmanager should work mostly mid shifts, working lunch through the busiest part of dinner.  \nThe assistant manager should work the busy day parts with open or close shifts.  The \nassistant  manager covers the mid shifts when the manager is not working.  Crew leaders \ncover the less busy closing and opening shifts.  \n \n \nShift Position Chart  \nThe shift position chart is a tool designed to be used by the manager on duty. The purpose \nof the chart is to ensure the manager on duty is positioning employees according to \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s deployment standards. Additionally, each position should be filled \nby a well -trained employee, ensuring we have our \u201caces in their places.\u201d Proper staffing, \ntraining, scheduling and positioning are all key components to be rush -ready and provide \nevery customer a great Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s experience.  \n \nThe shift position chart should be laminated and posted in area of the store visible to team \nmembers and out of view to customers. The manager on duty is responsible for filling in \nthe blanks before opening for lunch and after shift change for dinner. (Tip: Use a dry \nerase marker for easy marking and clean -up) \n \nThe shift position chart was designed to work in sync with the Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s \nlabor scheduling tools.  \n \nIn order for the position chart to be an effective tool for the manager on duty, the back -up \nwork must be done to ensure accurate schedules are created by using accurate and current \nsales.  \n \nAnytime the manager  assumes responsibility for a shift, one of the key responsibilities is \nto verify staff coverage for the shift. The first step is to review the schedule to be sure no \none will be running late to work, manager simply fills in the laminated position chart.  \n \nBy making the position chart part of the manager\u2019s daily routine, it forces them to \nconsider his or her team, and to place team members in positions that will ensure the best \nexperience for Cheeseburger Bobby\u2019s customers. Additionally, fellow employees wil l  \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 109 \n \ngrow accustomed to checking the chart as soon as they clock -in to begin work \nimmediately. By highlighting shift priorities and other team member\u2019s shifts, everyone \nwill be aware of in and out times and how they can support one another to make it a \nproduc tive workday.  Having the shift huddle for each shift in front of the position chart \nwill reinforce the manager\u2019s communication.  \n \nLabor Productivity Chart  \n \nIn order to figure the number of staff required per sales hours, you need the Labor \nProductivity Chart.  The chart gives you the information to layout.  \n \nOpening and Closing Labor Hours  \n \nOpening and closing hours are determined by the size of the restaurant, sales volume and \npre-closing hourly sales.  The size of the restaurant impacts closing hours, t he bigger the \ndining room/kitchen area the longer it can take to close.  Another impact on closing hours \nis the sales volume of the hours just before close.  Higher sales volumes make reduce the \namount of pre -closing that can be done, therefore increasing work to be done at close.  \nLastly sales volume impacts the morning prep need to get the restaurant ready to open.   \n \nAs a starting point, it is recommended to schedule 4 to 5 hours for opening and 4 hours \nfor closing.  The 5 hours for opening includes:  \n1. Two employees arrive at 9 a.m.  \n2. The third employee arrives at 10 a.m.  This should be the restaurant manager \nor shift leader.  \n3. The opening checklist is completed with the restaurant ready to open at 10:45 \na.m.  \n \nThe 4 hours for closing includes:  \n1. Three closers a nd the shift leader/manager comprise the closing crew.   \n2. The closers are assigned to each of the closing zones:  dining room, service \narea, grill area, and kitchen.   \n3. Each closer completes their zone checklist and helps others complete closing \ntheir areas.    \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 - Copyright January 2012  Page 110 \n \n \n \nPosition Validation: Dish/Prep        \n \nInitial to indicate you have demonstrated competence in following areas:  \n \n \nMIT  \n \n____  Read the primary and secondary duties and follows proper practices  \n____  Adheres to critical success factors   \n____  Read the 3S\u2019s section of the Operations Manual  \n____  Demonstrated knowledge of the following Dish duties  \no 3 compartment sink standards with proper chemical levels  \no Sanitation usage of sanitizer buckets  \no Back of the house FIFO of dry storage  \no Walk -in cooler organized to  health department code  \no Security of back door locked at all times  \no Assist service Team Member  \no Completion of prep sheet/prepping of product to recipe adherence  \n____  Properly used cutlery and cutting boards  \n \n \n___________________________   _____________________ _________  \nManager -In-Training     Certified Trainer   Date  \n \n   \n \nCheeseburger Bobby\u2019s Manager In Training Manual \u00a9 -
