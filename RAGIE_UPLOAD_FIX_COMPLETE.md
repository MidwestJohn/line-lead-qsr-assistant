# Ragie Upload Fix - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Resolution

**Problem**: DOCX files were being uploaded successfully to the frontend and validated, but were failing to upload to Ragie with the error:
```
ERROR: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'build_request'
```

**Root Cause**: The Ragie client was being used incorrectly as a context manager:
```python
# INCORRECT - Ragie client doesn't support context manager
with self.client as ragie_client:
    response = ragie_client.documents.create(request=create_request)
```

**Solution**: Removed the context manager and used the client directly:
```python
# CORRECT - Direct client usage
response = self.client.documents.create(request=create_request)
```

## âœ… **Fix Applied**

### **File Modified**: `/backend/services/ragie_service_clean.py`

**Before**:
```python
with self.client as ragie_client:
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        create_request = {
            "file": {
                "file_name": Path(file_path).name,
                "content": f,
            },
            "metadata": ragie_metadata,
            "mode": "hi_res",
            "partition": self.partition
        }
        response = ragie_client.documents.create(request=create_request)
```

**After**:
```python
with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
    create_request = {
        "file": {
            "file_name": Path(file_path).name,
            "content": f,
        },
        "metadata": ragie_metadata,
        "mode": "hi_res",
        "partition": self.partition
    }
    response = self.client.documents.create(request=create_request)
```
